      <h1>Day 25 Post-Break Up</h1>
      <p>
        This reminds me of the time we fought and didn't speak for a whole day.
        I hope you don't think of this as that because my heart is breaking a
        bit more every day.

        Maybe I should convince myself that this is just a small fight and that
        rn we're in No Contact and we'll be fine. I think before coming to your
        place that was more or less true. But then somehow you thought the
        person you'd always spoken of as caring and attentive wouldn't notice
        that something is off and try and help.
      </p>
      <p>I was right btw. I did love you more.</p>
