      <h1>Day 1 Post-Break Up</h1>
      <p>
        We broke up yesterday. I don’t think I’ve fully grasped it yet. I miss
        you already. I know I need to start reflecting and healing, so that’s
        what I plan to do with this journal. I want to be productive and
        continue to learn the skills I’ve been trying to learn for the past
        couple months. I want to make money and work, so that I can build a life
        for myself, which you are part of. I want to become a better person so
        that I start to feel deserving of the kind of love you give me. I want
        to become a clearer person so that I can start to love you the way you
        need to be loved. I have goals and I will try my very best to succeed in
        them, so that we have a chance.
      </p>
      <p>Right now, I feel anger, sadness, fear and longing.</p>
      <p>
        Anger because I’m angry at you for suggesting to break up, thinking
        there was a possibility I’d say no. Anger because I’m angry at myself
        for being too proud and not being able to be vulnerable when I don’t see
        your face. Anger because I know we could have managed to do it
        differently and we didn’t because we gave up. Anger because I know in a
        month, I’ll still be angry about how we decided to go about this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sadness because I’m disappointed in the both of us. Sadness because I
        feel like if you loved me more and you wanted to be with me more, we
        might have had a chance, but I know that because of how much you loved
        me and how much you wanted to be with me, you think this is the only way
        we have a chance. Sadness because I wish I saw it that way too and I
        wish you saw it my way. Sadness because I miss you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fear because nothing is clear. Because I don’t know whether you’ll wake
        up tomorrow and decide to move on past a point of rekindling. Fear
        because I don’t know whether tomorrow is the day I see nothing left
        anymore. Fear because the future might be the most beautiful thing
        imaginable, or the most hurtful Fear because I love you so incredibly
        much, and now I have nowhere to put this love into, no vessel, nowhere
        to place it. Fear because what if we don’t find back to one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Longing because you are you and I am me. I’ve longed for you since
        January 2025 and I plan to long for you til January 2100. Longing
        because I’ve never felt loved the way I felt loved by you. Longing
        because you are the most beautiful person in this world and I have not
        felt this love towards another person. Longing because when I think of
        the fact that I have lost the privilege of your attention and your love,
        your touch and your caress, my heart physically hurts. Longing because
        if I could do anything right now to get you back and to feel happy with
        you again, I would. I would literally do anything in this world, may it
        be to start a World War, just to lie in your arms until death does me
        part.
      </p>
      <p>
        I miss you. And I love you. And I’ll miss you tomorrow and the day after
        that and the day after that. And I’ll love you tomorrow and the day
        after that. And I’ll miss you for every day after that, and love you for
        just as long. You are my love and even if I let you go physically, will
        let you go mentally, I’ll never let you go emotionally because you
        settled in my heart and you can’t just pack up and move out from there.
