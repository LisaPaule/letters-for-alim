      <h1>Happy One Month Anniversary!!!</h1>
      <p>Dear Alim,</p>
      <p>
        I can't believe it's already been one month since this beautiful journey
        began. A single month may seem short, but it feels like we've lived a
        lifetime of momentsâ€”tiny bits of laughter, whispers, and shared tears.
        You've shown me how love can sneak up on you and hold you soooo tightly,
        there's no letting go.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want you to know that every second with you has been a gift. Your
        smile brightens my day, your voice calms my anxieties, and your heart
        has become the center of my world. I cherish every moment I'm allowed to
        spend beside you, those we spend lying in bed, those we spend sitting in
        the same room doing different things, those we spend sleeping, but my
        most favourite ones are the mornings we share. The feeling of waking up
        next to you, holding your hand while you sleep, having you pull me close
        so that I don't immediately stand up, having your sleepy eyes find mine
        and your soft lifts peck mine. It's the most beautiful thing in the
        world, and the thing I miss the most when we don't sleep together. There
        is not a day that goes by where I'm not thankful for the choice we made
        to be together. There's not an hour that passes by where I don't wonder
        how I deserved you. There's not a minute that passes by where I don't
        wish to be even closer to you, regardless of whether I'm already
        basically inside of you. There's not a second that passes by in which I
        don't want to feel your incredibly strong heart beat right under the
        palm of my hands or right under my ear. And last, but not least, there's
        not a moment that passes by where I'm not incredibly aware of how lucky
        I am to call myself your girlfriend.
      </p>
      <p>
        And everytime you fall asleep beside me, I am incredibly happy and
        grateful. Happy that I give you peace enough for you to rest beside me.
        Grateful that I was brought into your life to allow you to rest. And
        everytime I look you in the eye while I feel soo self-conscious about
        myself, I am incredibly happy and grateful. Happy that you gave me peace
        enough for me to expose myself so happily to you. Grateful that you were
        brought into my life to allow me to feel at peace with myself enough to
        show myself to you.
      </p>
      As you know, we've been together for only a month. But I'm very grateful
      for that, we've managed to identify and (somewhat at least) fix mistakes
      we saw. And I'm so happy I was there to provide you with enough love that
      you understood that everything is fine regardless and that your brain can
      rest from that at least for a bit. I know this bothered you a lot, even
      when I told you repeatedly that all is good. And I understand. But I'm
      very happy that I was, once again, proven right. Because guess what? It is
      all good. But I'll stop bragging about my all-knowing brain, and go back
      to the reason for me writing this letter.
      <p>
        Happy one month anniversary, my love. It has been a great journey, and a
        great month. Let's hope we have at least another 1199 months left
        surrounded by this happiness. I love you so incredibly much.
      </p>
      <p>In love,</p>
      <p>Your Lisa</p>
