      <h2>Happy Four Month Anniversay!!!</h2>
      <p>Dear Allyedge</p>
      <p>
        Four months ago, we began a journey that has been filled with love,
        growth, and unforgettable moments. Through all the highs and lows, we've
        only grown, and today, I want to celebrate the incredible connection we
        share. "You will always be in my heart with unconditional love." (2Pac,
        "Unconditional Love")
      </p>
      <p>
        Your care for me has been one of the cornerstones of our relationship,
        the same way my love and care for you has. And especially by being apart
        from you, I've learned that "I don't wanna give you the wrong
        impression, I need your love and affection." (Rihanna ft. Future,
        "Loveeeeeee Song") Your presence brings comfort and warmth to my life.
        The way you hold me, listen to me, and stand by me speaks volumes more
        than words ever could. "I hope you never leave, I give you my heart, I
        mean it." (Lil Baby ft. Fridayy, "Forever") Every day with you feels
        like a second chance to do the things wrong I did yesterday, to retry to
        make you see how much I truly love you. You have taught me so many
        things, such as for example how to do exactly what I'm doing right now.
        But also, you've taught me to stand up to myself, to trust you, to
        accept myself as equal to others. And you have taugh me the true meaning
        of partnership and commitment. "She wanna know who I am, she don't give
        a f* who I was." (Lil Tecca & Ken Carson, "Fell In Love") You've
        accepted me for who I am, embracing both my strengths and my flaws. Your
        acceptance has allowed me to grow and become a better person.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I did things for you, even when you ain't ask me to." (Lil Baby,
        "Everything") Through you I've learned that it is equal in a
        relationship. You give and you get. And also I learned that I sometimes
        didn't pay attention to when you'd give, but more when you took. But
        ever since, I've been trying to be more attentive and see you–for who
        you are. And I've learned that the little things you do make a big
        difference in my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        One more thing I've learned about myself in the past months of our
        relationship is that "I wanna be confident when I say you my lady, I
        wanna be arrogant when I say you mine, baby." (Future, "LOVE YOU
        BETTER") Being with you fills me with pride. And I want the same for
        you. Your love empowers me and gives me the confidence to face anything
        that comes our way. "We must remember that tomorrow comes after the
        dark." (2Pac, "Unconditional Love") So, through every storm, we've found
        our rainbow. Your touch, your words, your presence—every aspect of you
        brings me peace and joy. "I hope you never leave, I give you my heart, I
        mean it." (Lil Baby ft. Fridayy, "Forever") As we celebrate this
        milestone, I look forward to many more years of laughter, love, and
        shared dreams. Thank you for being my partner, my confidant, and my
        greatest love.
      </p>
      <p>Happy Anniversary, my love.</p>
      <p>Forever yours.</p>
