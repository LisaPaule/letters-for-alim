        <p class="textopen">Alim,</p>
        <p class="textopen">
          Considering I know you, I know you believe such a statement as in my
          heading is extremely vague and a stupid statement to make considering
          it depends heavily on what the fight is about, and what has been said
          and done. And I agree. It depends...
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          ...But if it's bad enough for you to be reading this, but
          understandind that the words said here are invalid, then yes, the
          heading likely doesn't apply. But if reading these makes your heart
          calm down a bit, makes you smile, smirk or even feel a tiny bit
          better, or if the existence of this website makes you feel better
          about our fight and what I might've fucked up with, then these words
          are still as genuine as they are in the moment I'm writing them.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          And I need you to understand that it's fine to fight. I know you don't
          like it, and you think it's useless and stupid, but I need you to
          understand that people fight for good reason. They fight because
          they're emotionally charged, and because they know their partner loves
          them enough to continue loving them even when they disagree and say
          stupid, emotional stuff to one another, because their significant
          other knows they don't mean it. (They fight because making-up sex is
          the best kind of sex.)
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          So, we had a fight. A fight. A disagreement. A difference of opinion,
          if you will. And look, I know I'm probably right (I mean,
          statistically speaking, the chances are very high), but that's not the
          point here. The point is… I already know that I don't like this. I
          won't like fighting with you. Thinking off being apart with a negative
          meaning behind it makes my heart feel all weird and twisty, but in a
          bad way.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          Even though I know I'm right (I promise I'll stop saying that… maybe),
          I also know that what matters more than being right is us. And the
          last thing I want is for this dumb fight to put any distance between
          us, because honestly? You're way too important to me for that.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">So, let's do this:</p>
        <p class="textopen">
          You forgive me for whatever tiny, insignificant thing I might have
          done, and I'll forgive you for being so tragically wrong (last time, I
          swear). And then we can go back to doing what we do best—being stupid
          together, making bad jokes, and me pretending not to laugh at them.
          Deal?
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">Good.</p>
        <p class="textopen">
          Now come here and let me dramatically sigh into your shoulder about
          how exhausting it is to be always right.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          Your completely reasonable, never-wrong, very humble girlfriend

        ... you are unsure whether we can fix it.

      <div class="nrtwo">
        <p class="textopen">Dear Alim,</p>
        <p class="textopen">
          We've fought before, but this feels different. It's not just a
          disagreement–it's a fracture that's sitting between us, and I don't
          know if it can be sealed. We've both said and done things in the heat
          of the moment that can't be erased, and now there's a distance that
          wasn't there before.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          I’m not going to pretend this is a small matter or that time will
          automatically fix it. This isn’t about forgetting—it’s about whether
          we can live with what’s happened and still choose each other after.
          Right now, I’m not certain we can. I still care about you, but caring
          isn’t always enough. Sometimes love and compatibility aren’t the same
          thing, and sometimes good intentions still cause damage that doesn’t
          fully heal.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          If we’re going to try to come back from this, it can’t be about
          “moving on” without addressing the actual wound. I need to know
          whether we’re capable of rebuilding something honest and strong enough
          to hold us together, or if this fight is the point where we start
          breaking apart for good.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          I'm not saying this as some form of an ultimatum. I'm saying this
          because I know sometimes it's hard to see another way of it being, or
          a time in which it'll be better. And while right now, I might not see
          it, I know it is there. I just need to know you do too.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          And I truly believe if we sit down, take each other seriously and show
          one another empathy, we will be fine. If we show that we care and love
          each other the way the other one needs to be loved, which we've
          managed to do already at one point in time, then I'm sure we will be
          fine.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">So, let's do this:</p>
        <p class="textopen">
          We breathe first, then we sit down together and decide on how to
          continue. I want to be with you and I want to make you feel loved all
          of the time, but I also want the same for you. And for me that
          includes the little things. I want you to tell me what I can do to
          make you feel the same. I want to love you the right way. So please,
          let's just talk.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          And then, when we're done talking, let's actively decide to be better
          and do better, and trust each other in our actions and our feelings.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          I love you and I never want you to feel like I'd stop or didn't in the
          first place. You are who I decided to spend this time of my life with,
          and I don't and have never regretted that. I hope you didn't either. I
          just wanna try to make sure it doesn't stay in this time-frame, so
          that we can continue and love each other for as long as possible. I
          just want us to come out of this stronger than we went in.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">I love you and need you and likely miss you,</p>

        <p class="textopen">Dear Dudu,</p>
        <p class="textopen">
          I know we can’t rewind and unsay the things that came out in the heat
          of the moment. I wish we could, because neither of us meant to hurt
          the other as much as we did. But the fact that we can’t take them back
          doesn’t mean they have to keep hurting us forever.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          Words said in anger don’t erase the love that’s still there
          underneath. They don’t undo every good moment or every choice we’ve
          made to stay together. We are human, and sometimes we let frustration
          or fear speak louder than the truth. What matters now is what we do
          with this—whether we hold onto the worst things we’ve said or choose
          to focus on the best things we still mean.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          I want you to know that I’m still here. I still want you. I still
          believe in us. We can’t erase the past, but we can create a future
          that makes those words smaller in comparison
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          Obviously, you're also part of the equation, and so it's your choice
          to either take them as the truth and hold them close, or hold them at
          a distance but keep it in the back of our heads.
        </p>

        <p class="textopen">
          When tears are shed, they're not weakness–it was proof of how much
          this matters to us. We wouldn't cry if we didn't care. We wouldn't
          feel this deeply if we didn't value what we have.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          It is something real that shows we're invested enough in each other to
          let our guards down, even when it's uncomfortable. That takes trust.
          It takes love.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          Please don't let those tears be a sign of the end. I want them to be a
          turning point–a reminder that we have something worth fighting for.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          I'm willing to work through the mess if it means we get back to the
          good. And I believe we can, because even in the hardest moments, I
          will still choose you. As long as you choose me.

          I know you’ve questioned whether you’re enough, or whether I love you
          for who you really are and not some version of you I’ve made up in my
          head. I want to be clear: I fell for you—the real you. Not the
          polished version, not the one you think you have to be for me, but the
          whole person in front of me, flaws and all.

        <p class="textopen">
          You don’t have to perform for my love. You don’t have to shape
          yourself into something else. I’m here because of who you are at your
          core, not because of what you could become. If I’ve ever made you
          doubt that, then I’m sorry, because that’s never been my intention or
          my thoughts.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          You are enough, right now, as you are. I’m not with you to change
          you—I’m with you because I see something rare and worth holding onto.
          I don’t want you to be “perfect” for me. I want you to be yourself,
          because that’s the person I love. I want you to love me the way you
          want to and the way I need you too.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          To be with you is the most important part of my love. To have you love
          me and do the same to you is the beauty I seek to see and feel every
          single day.

        <p class="textopen">
          You are enough. More than that, you are everything.
