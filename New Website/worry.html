          If you feel like you need to cry, then that's okay. I hope you know
          that—really know it. Crying doesn't make you weak, and it sure as hell
          doesn't make me see you any differently. If anything, it reminds me
          how deeply you feel, how much heart you carry inside you. And that's
          one of the many, many things I adore about you.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          But if I'm being honest? The thought of you crying makes my chest ache
          in a way I can't even explain. It's like someone's wringing my heart
          out like a wet cloth, and I hate knowing that something has made you
          feel this way. If I could, I'd steal away whatever's hurting you and
          drop-kick it into another dimension. And if that didn't work, I'd
          bribe it with snacks until it agreed to leave you alone.

        <p class="textopen">Dear Alim,</p>
        <p class="textopen">
          If you’re worried about us, I want you to hear this clearly: I’m still
          here, and I still choose you. Whatever the doubt, whatever the fear,
          it doesn’t change the fact that I’m committed to making this work.
          Relationships aren’t always smooth, and there are times when the noise
          in our heads can make us question what’s solid. But I don’t want you
          to carry those worries alone, especially when they’re about us.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          I know we won’t be perfect every day. We’ll have moments that test us,
          moments that make us wonder if we’re on the same page. But what
          matters is that we talk, we listen, and we keep choosing to work
          through it instead of walking away. I’m not here for only the easy
          days. I’m here for the full picture—your good moods, your bad moods,
          our best moments, our tense ones, and everything in between.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          If you’re worried I don’t care as much as I used to, or that I’m
          pulling away, I need you to know that’s not the truth. You matter to
          me—still, fully, deeply. Even when we frustrate each other. Even when
          we misunderstand each other. My commitment isn’t conditional on
          everything always feeling perfect. It’s built on the fact that I want
          a life with you, and that includes the times when we have to steady
          ourselves.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          So talk to me when you’re worried. Tell me what’s on your mind instead
          of holding it in. Let me remind you that we’re on the same team. We’ve
          gotten through things before, and we can get through more. This isn’t
          me promising that nothing will ever feel uncertain again—it’s me
          promising that when it does, I won’t run. I’ll stay, and I’ll fight
          for us, because you’re worth it.

      <div class="nrthree">
        <p class="textopen">My Alim,</p>
        <p class="textopen">
          If you’re afraid of failing, I want you to remember something: failing
          doesn’t mean you’re not capable—it means you’re human. Every single
          person you admire, every success story you’ve ever heard, came with a
          long list of mistakes, wrong turns, and setbacks. You’re not an
          exception to that rule, and you don’t need to be.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          I know you set high standards for yourself. I know you want to get it
          right, to do it well, to make it count. But the fear of failing can be
          heavier than the thing you’re actually trying to do. It can make you
          freeze, overthink, or doubt the skills and strengths you already have.
          And I wish you could see yourself the way I do in those
          moments—capable and far more ready than you feel. I know you've been
          thinking a lot about the coming school year, as you should. But you
          should know that whatever you think you're not capable of is just a
          creation of your mind.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          You’ve failed before, and you’ve gotten back up. Maybe you don’t give
          yourself enough credit for that. You’ve faced things that didn’t go as
          planned, things a lot of people couldn't move past from and yet you’re
          still here, still trying, still pushing forward. That’s resilience.
          That’s strength. That’s proof that even if something doesn’t work out,
          you’re not the kind of person who stays down.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          If the worst happened and you did stumble, I wouldn’t think less of
          you. I wouldn’t walk away. I wouldn’t see you as “less.” I’d be here
          to help you figure out what’s next, to remind you that one outcome
          doesn’t define your worth or your future. You don’t need to be perfect
          for me. You don’t even need to succeed every time. You just need to
          keep showing up, and I’ll be right here, proud of you for doing that,
          no matter what.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">You are who I choose,</p>
        <p class="textopen">I love you,</p>
        <p class="textopen">Yours, Lisa</p>
