      <h2>Happy Six Month Anniversary!!!</h2>
      <p>Dear Romeo,</p>
      <p>
        Six months is a long time. I am unbelievably proud of us for how far
        we've come, and how well we've managed to maintain this love we have for
        one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Us supporting and loving each other the way we have has been a pleasure
        for me, as I hope it has for you. You have shown me how to laugh with a
        person right after having cried. You have shown me how to feel desired
        and how to truly desire another person. You have shown me attraction,
        intimacy, truth, passion, understanding, hurt and endurance. But most
        importantly you have shown me how it feels to really love a person.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really love you, Alim. With all our ups and downs, all the flaws we
        will continue to find in each other, all the seemingly-heartbroken
        nights and the dreamlike mornings. And I will continue to love you for
        at least the next 200 6-months.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started this tradition about 5 months ago, with the intention of
        making you feel me close to you at any point in time you wish. And while
        it did take me 5 months to finish, I think I have with everything I
        wanted so far. Once I've worked on my overall computer and programming
        skills, I will update this and make it a notes app or something, in
        which you can always read and I can update more regularly.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really hope we get to that point in our relationship, but I believe
        that we can if we put ourselves aside and prioritise what is
        importantâ€“us. (And if I manage to get my shit together, stop
        procastinating and continue learning.) I know sometimes I can be hard on
        myself, on you, to handle, generally hard, but please don't give up on
        me.
      </p>
      <p>Happy Anniversary, my love.</p>
      <p>
        I try to be better, get better, and sometimes, it's hard. When that
        happens, I hope I don't make you feel it, but if I should, please
        forgive me. I know it's egoistic of me to ask that from you, and I'd
        never want you to forgive me for something unforgiveable or something
        bad enough (I think you know that), but I'm just asking you to hold on
        to us, if you can (and want). I want to build a future with you, and I
        hope you do too.
      </p>
      <p>I appreciate you. I love you.</p>
      <p>Your buburito</p>
