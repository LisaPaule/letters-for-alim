      <h1>Happy Three Month Anniversary!!!</h1>
      <p>My love,</p>
      <p>
        Three months. Three whole months of being yours and you being mine.
        Three months of growing, of learning, of laughing... and yes, even of a
        few misunderstandings and arguments. I know things have felt a little
        off lately—like maybe we’ve been just slightly out of sync, missing each
        other in the little moments, feeling less connected than usual maybe
        too. But I also know this: love isn't always just butterflies and
        daydreams. Sometimes, it's messy. Sometimes, it stumbles. And I think
        that's part of the journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        While recently, I think there's been a couple of moments in which I felt
        like we were crumbling a bit maybe, not because anything changed in the
        way I perceive our relationship or my love for you, but just because I
        felt less emotional supoort than usual (which is usually a good thing,
        just the past two weeks hard to deal with), I still think we're going
        strong. After having thought a lot about the talks we had especially at
        the beginning of our relationship, I have come to the conclusion that
        some of the things I thought were realistic in a healthy relationship,
        probably aren't. An example for this is something we've had a couple of
        disagreements over lately. I think it's important to assume, especially
        when it comes to emotion. Oftentimes, it's very hard for the other
        person to speak up for themselves or make the first move first. Because,
        at least in my case, there's soo much overthinking involved, and just
        this constant fear that expressing my emotions and thoughts won't help.
        And maybe even that you'll realise how strenuous and unrewarding it is
        to be in a relationship with me, causing you to just leave. I've thought
        about this a lot recently, not because I in any way want to, or because
        you really gave any indication that you want to, but I don't think you
        quite understand what it's like in the mind of an overthinker. My
        constant, every thought is about how I can make you the least annoyed
        with me as possible, how I can keep you, how I can please you and how I
        can make this last as long as possible. It's like I'm so scared you'll
        leave me that I can't enjoy the time you're still here. And when you're
        gone, I will wish I had enjoyed it more, and that's what really scares
        me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not usually a very emotional person. You can ask anybody who knows
        me well, and they will tell you two things about me: I don't cry, and I,
        per usual, don't care. Not enough to fight for it. But I've cried.
        Thrice this week. And I didn't like it. And I didn't want to. But what
        felt worse is that I didn't want you to know that I had, or that I was.
        Let me tell you what's constantly running through my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first time I cried was on Wednesday I think. After you asked me why
        I was sad and I couldn't give you an answer. You got frustrated,
        understandably, and I cried not because I was that sad, but because I
        wasn't a good enough girlfriend to keep you out of my head. My thoughts
        were spinning, and it wasn't stopping or slowing down. And so I
        overheated. I was so worried. Worried you'd be so annoyed with me.
        Worried you'd realise you deserve better. Worried you'd simply be fed
        up. And so I couldn't keep it bottled up anymore, and I cried. In the
        bathroom. Silently. And then afterwards I washed my face with cold
        water, rinsed my eyes out to and five minutes later, when we spoke, you
        didn't notice. And while that made me glad because I didn't want you to
        feel bad or worry about me, or leave your PC to console me, I also
        wondered what I'm doing. I wondered whether this is a form of
        self-sabotage I'm committing and I got so incredibly sad at the thought
        of losing you because of my twisted, fucked-up brain making up something
        in my head to ruin the beautiful reality I share with you. And then came
        Thursday, and I cried again. I don't even know why. I just did. But I
        smiled through it, because I didn't want you to notive that I was sad
        again. And I didn't want you to know. Because in a way it's embarassing.
        And useless, and it's not me. But maybe it's becoming me. And I don't
        know what to do about it. And then came Friday morning. I woke up and
        decided to be happy. I decided today I wouldn't be sad, I'd be happy,
        and I'd make you believe that it's all fine again. And it was the
        morning right after you woke up, and you asked me not to cuddle so much
        because it is a waste of time. Or rather, the amount we do it wastes
        hours of the day. And you're not wrong, and I want you to always be
        honest with me about what you're feeling, but I don't know. It hit me.
        And it made me sad, because it was in a way exactly what I'd feared. It
        was that feeling of distance. The breaking of patterns leads to the
        allowance of change. And change leads to disinvolvement. And
        disinvolvement leads to breaking up. So because I had decided to not
        show my sadness, I went on a walk. I know you know I was sad. But at
        least this way, you didn't see the extent of it. I walked through Grone,
        I bought a drink and I sat down at a bench and cried. Because I was so
        tired. Not of you or because of anything you'd done. But because of me,
        and how broken I am. But then I stood back up, put my shoulders back and
        decided that this is not who I am. Sometimes, people go through rough
        patches, and I believe this time, I'm allowed to be sad. I'm allowed and
        supposed to acknowledge that it is hard right now, even when that is
        partially my fault. And I am going to be okay.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also want you to know that nothing about the way I see you has
        changed. Nothing about the way I feel for you has faded. You are still
        the same person who makes my heart beat a little too fast when you walk
        into a room. You’re still the same soul I want to wake up next to every
        morning—whether we fell asleep laughing or after a fight or argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        What we’re going through? I think it’s part of it. Part of learning how
        to love each other better. How to communicate without fear, how to hold
        space without needing to fix everything, how to choose each other even
        when it’s hard. And the beautiful thing is—we’re doing it. Even when it
        might be hard at times, we’re still here. Still trying. Still choosing
        each other. And that matters more to me than one tear shed or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m not scared of rough patches, because I believe in us. I believe in
        what we have. I believe we’re strong enough, honest enough, and we love
        enough about each other to be okay. I trust the way you love me, and I
        hope you trust the way I love you, too. Fully, and at all times.
      </p>
      <p>
        So here’s to three months of loving each other—on the easy days, and on
        the ones where we don’t get it quite right. Here’s to all the times
        we’ve laughed until our stomachs hurt, and all the times we’ve held onto
        each other a little tighter after hard conversations. Here's to what
        we’ve already built, and everything still to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        I still want the whole future with you, Alim. I still see that apartment
        that smells like brownies and you. I still see Jen and Ilya and the baby
        with no name stealing my cuddles. I still see you and me—maybe a little
        older, maybe a little greyer (even tho you're already grey at 18..
        damn), but still tangled up in each other, still arguing about dishes
        and still sooo in love.
      </p>
      <p>Happy three months, my dudu. You are my home.</p>
      <p>In love (still, always),</p>
      <p>Your Lisa</p>
      <p>
        <strong>PS:</strong> I will never count. Not the cuddles, not the
        arguments, not the days we’re off, not the days we’re perfect. Just the
        fact that it’s you. Always you.
