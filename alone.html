          Dear Alim, I know that sometimes the world can feel heavy, and even in
          a room full of people, loneliness can creep in like a quiet shadow.
          But I want you to know that you're never truly alone—not while I'm
          here, not while my heart beats with yours in mind. You are someone who
          matters, who makes the world a softer, kinder place just by being in
          it.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          If ever you feel like no one sees you, please know that I do. I see
          the way your presence brings warmth, the way your words carry meaning,
          the way your heart holds more depth than you sometimes realize.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          Even in silence, I hope you feel my presence beside you. Even in
          distance, I hope you know my thoughts are with you. I wish I could
          take every lonely moment and replace it with the certainty that you
          are deeply, unshakably cherished. Because you are.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          This is just the beginning of us, but already, I feel so lucky to know
          you. And if you ever need a reminder that you're not alone, just close
          your eyes—I'll be there, holding onto you with all the love I have.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">Yours, always, Lisa</p>

      <div class="nrtwo">
        <p class="textopen">Hey, you</p>
        <p class="textopen">
          If you're reading this, I need you to do something for me. Close your
          eyes for a moment and take a deep breath. Imagine my arms wrapped
          around you, holding you close, as if I could squeeze away the
          loneliness and replace it with warmth. Feel the steady, quiet
          reassurance in that hug—the kind that doesn't need words, just
          presence.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          I know that sometimes the world feels too big, too empty, or too far
          away. I know that loneliness can creep in, even in a room full of
          people. And I know that, in moments like this, you just need to feel
          held—not just physically, but in the way that reminds you that you
          belong, that you are loved, and that you are never truly alone.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          So, let this be your reminder: You are not alone. Even when the
          silence stretches too wide, even when your thoughts feel too loud, I
          am here. Maybe not always in the way I wish I could be, but in every
          way that matters. I am here in the words of this letter. I am here in
          the memories we share. I am here in the warmth of the sun, in the
          quiet of the night, in the songs that bring you comfort.
        </p>

        <p class="textopen">
          And when you need that hug the most, I hope you can feel this
          one—gentle, steady, full of all the love and care I have for you.
          Because you deserve to feel safe, to feel seen, to feel wrapped in
          something soft and certain.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">You are not alone, my dear. Never.</p>

        <p class="textopen">Hey, Alim</p>
        <p class="textopen">
          I know that sometimes life feels heavy, and the weight of everything
          can be too much to carry on your own. I also know that distance can
          make it seem like no one is close enough to hold you up when you need
          it most. But I want you to know—no matter how far apart we may be, you
          are never truly alone.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          If I could be there right now, I would sit beside you in the quiet,
          offering nothing but presence until the silence feels less
          overwhelming. I would listen, not just to the words you say but to the
          ones you can't bring yourself to speak. I would remind you, over and
          over, that you don't have to face this alone.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          But even from a distance, I'm still here. I'm here in the messages I
          send, in the memories we share, in the quiet way I think of you even
          when we're not talking. I'm here in the certainty that, no matter how
          many miles stretch between us, you always have a place to rest your
          worries, your thoughts, your heart.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          So, if you need a friend to lean on, lean on me. In whatever way you
          can, in whatever way you need. Whether it's a message in the middle of
          the night, a quiet knowing that someone cares, or simply the comfort
          of knowing you don't have to hold it all by yourself—I'm here. Always.

        <p class="textopen">Hello, Pookiebear</p>
        <p class="textopen">
          I know how lonely it feels when the world doesn't seem to speak your
          language, when your thoughts feel too tangled to explain, and when it
          seems like no one truly sees you for who you are. That kind of
          loneliness isn't just about being alone—it's about feeling unseen,
          unheard, like you're standing in a crowd and still feeling invisible.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          But even in this moment, I want you to know: I see you. I may not know
          every thought running through your mind, every feeling weighing on
          your heart, but I do know you. And I know that you are more than what
          others fail to understand. You are real, you are important, and your
          thoughts, your feelings, your existence—they matter.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          Even if the world doesn't always get it, even if people fail to meet
          you where you are, I am here. Maybe I don't have all the answers, and
          maybe I can't always say the perfect words, but I will always, always
          be here to listen, to sit with you in the silence, to remind you that
          you don't have to be understood by everyone to be worthy of love, of
          belonging, of feeling safe.
        </p>

        <p class="textopen">
          You are not alone. You are not too much. You are not wrong for feeling
          what you feel. And even on the days when it feels like no one
          understands, I hope you can carry this truth with you—I am here, I
          care, and you never have to face this alone.

        <p class="textopen">
          I know that sometimes life feels like a bad WiFi connection—slow,
          frustrating, and constantly buffering when you need it the most. But
          just like WiFi, happiness has a way of coming back when you least
          expect it (usually after you threaten to throw your router out the
          window).
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          So, since you need a little spark today, let me throw some
          ridiculousness your way: Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because
          he was outstanding in his field.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          I told my suitcase that there will be no vacations this year. Now I'm
          dealing with emotional baggage.

          Parallel lines have so much in common. It's a shame they'll never

          Okay, okay, I'll stop before you roll your eyes so hard you strain
          something. But seriously, if today feels a little gray, just remember:
          somewhere in the world, a raccoon is probably washing its hands in a
          tiny puddle, a dog is having the time of its life sticking its head
          out of a car window, and I am sitting here, sending all my good vibes
          your way.
        </p>

        <p class="textopen">
          You are awesome. You are loved. And if nothing else, at least you now
          have some terribly amazing jokes to tell people (or to make them groan
          in secondhand embarrassment—both are valid).

          I know that right now, it might feel like the days are dragging on,
          like you're stuck in a loop of the same old routine, or like the
          future is a blurry question mark. But let me tell you something—there
          are so many incredible moments ahead of you. And no, I'm not just
          talking about the day when we finally get eight full hours of sleep
          while sleeping in the same bed (though that will be pretty great,
          too).
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          I'm talking about the kind of moments that make life worth sticking
          around for. The inside jokes you haven't even created yet, the places
          you haven't explored, the new favorite foods you haven't tried. The
          deep, unexpected conversations at 2 a.m., the songs you'll play on
          repeat until you're sick of them, the random days that seem ordinary
          but end up being unforgettable.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          Somewhere in your future, there's a day when you'll laugh so hard
          you'll have to gasp for air. Just think of my grandfather and
          seventeen back-shots. Think of a moment when everything finally clicks
          and makes sense. A hug that will make every bad day leading up to it
          feel worth it. There are people you haven't even met yet who will love
          you in ways you can't imagine.
        </p>

        <p class="textopen">
          And when those moments arrive, I hope you look back at today and
          think:
        </p>

        <p class="textopen">
          Wow, I had no idea all these good things were coming
        </p>

        <p class="textopen">
          So hold on. Keep going. The best days of your life aren't just in the
          past—they're waiting for you, just around the corner.

        <p class="textopen">Alim Arslan Kaya,</p>
        <p class="textopen">
          I can't even believe I'm writing this letter right now. I'm writing a
          letter that contradicts the actual essense of life, one that
          insinuates you believe you believe you're not enough. And that in
          itself is simply and truly ridiculous.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          So let's get one thing straight: this letter should not exist. It goes
          against every undeniable truth about who you are. But since you're
          reading it, since you need it right now, I'll spell it out for you.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          You matter. End of story. There is no version of the world where your
          existence is anything less than valuable, where your presence is
          anything less than necessary. You have left footprints on hearts you
          don't even realize. You have shaped lives just by being in them. You
          have made people feel seen, understood, and cared for—probably without
          even trying.
        </p>

        <p class="textopen">
          So why do I have to remind you of something that is so clearly true?
          Why do you feel like this letter needs to be read, when in reality, it
          should be completely unnecessary? Maybe because you've been too busy
          being good to others to notice how much you mean to them. Maybe
          because your mind is playing tricks on you, making you believe a lie
          that is so ridiculously untrue, I almost feel offended on your behalf.
        </p>

        <p class="textopen">
          If you could see yourself the way the world sees you, the way I see
          you, you would laugh at the very idea of this letter. You would
          crumple it up and throw it away because of course you matter. Of
          course the world would be emptier without you. Of course you bring
          something unique and irreplaceable just by existing.
        </p>

        <p class="textopen">
          But if today isn't one of those days—if today is a day when you just
          can't see it—then let this letter exist for as long as you need it.
          Let my words be the truth when your mind tries to tell you otherwise.
          And when you're ready, when you can finally see yourself the way you
          deserve to be seen, I hope you'll look back at this letter and laugh.
          Because of course you matter. You always have. You always will.
        </p>

        <p class="textopen">
          With all my love and frustration that this letter even needs to exist,
