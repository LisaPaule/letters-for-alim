      <h2>Happy Five Month Anniversary!!!</h2>
      <p>Mi amor</p>
      <p>
        It feels like both the quickest and most meaningful stretch of time I’ve
        ever lived. Each day with you adds another layer to what we have—more
        trust, more understanding, more love. We’ve been learning each other in
        ways that make me realize just how rare it is to find something this
        real. “From the first day I met you, it was special.” (Future, I'M DAT
        N***A)
      </p>
      <p>
        Being with you has shown me that love isn’t just about the highs—it’s
        about standing together when things are uncertain, when life feels
        heavy, when we don’t have all the answers. “Even when I'm wrong, you're
        right there to hold me down.” (2Pac, Me and My Girlfriend) I’ve seen the
        strength in your heart and the way you give yourself to the people you
        love. You’ve made me feel safe enough to do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve noticed the little ways you’ve shaped me without even trying—how I
        speak up more, how I trust deeper, how I let myself be fully seen. I
        just want you to know: “You are appreciated.” (2Pac, Keep Ya Head Up)
        You’ve shown me that my flaws aren’t things to hide, but parts of me you
        still choose, every single day.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we’re apart, I hold on to the thought of you like an anchor. Your
        voice, your laugh, the way you look at me—it all stays with me. “No
        matter the distance, I'm comin' to you.” (Future, Love You Better)
        You’re my person, in every season, in every distance. I want you to know
        that I’m proud to love you. Not quietly, not halfway, but all in. “I
        just wanna take you out and show you off.” (Future, Turn On The Lights)
        You make me want to be better—not because you demand it, but because
        being with you feels like something worth protecting and growing.
      </p>
      <p>
        So here’s to five months of us—and to the endless months ahead. You’ve
        given me more joy than I thought possible, more peace than I thought I
        deserved, and more love than I knew how to ask for. “My unconditional
        love for you will never die.” (2Pac, Unconditional Love)
      </p>
      <p>Happy Anniversary, my love.</p>
      <p>Here’s to everything we’ve built and everything still to come.</p>
      <p>In love,</p>
      <p>Il tuo amore</p>
