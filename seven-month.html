      <h2>Happy Seven Month Anniversary!!!</h2>
      <p>My darling,</p>
      <p>
        We're now officially seven months together. Isn't that crazy? And I
        think by now we can both claim we've had some rougher times in our
        relationship. But I think we can say that we will surpass those.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have spent the last couple of weeks thinking about us and our
        relationship and while I've always said that I love you, I don't think
        either one of us really understood what I meant by that.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love you more than any fight we could ever have, any disagreement, any
        tough time. So here are seven reasons why I love you (One for every
        month we've been together):
      </p>
      <p>
        I love you because you are my safe place (even though you're also the
        most nerve-racking thing in my life) and all I want is to lie in your
        arms and breathe in that cologne of yours that I always crave.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love you because you make me want to be better and do better, whether
        that is in my actions or my being.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love you because I love to try for you. I love sitting and learning a
        new skill for something I can do for you. I love working with you or
        creating something new with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love you because when you sit down and take your time to explain or
        teach something to me, you try to be patient even though you are a
        pretty impatient person, my love. And when I don't get it, you explain
        it again. And when I don't get it again, you give me time to learn it
        myself or practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love you because you consider me. Because after you shower and I am
        already asleep waiting for you, you come and gently wake me to go brush
        teeth. And even though you don't like patterns, you always brush teeth
        with me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love you because when I have a nightmare and I wake up scared or just
        can't sleep, I can cuddle you and you hug me back in your sleep. Or when
        I'm sleeping and you're not with me in bed, when u come and you kiss my
        forehead or another part of me, I love how the butterflies in my stomach
        make me feel nauseaus.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love you because you care for me. When I have a migraine and I can't
        take it, you put an umbrella on your bed to stop the sunlight from
        hitting my face. You give me a pants, a cookie and a powerbank when I'm
        out at night in the cold, you hug me like I'm precious.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love you because after all the hard times and negative thoughts, all
        it takes is seeing you or having you tell me you love me and reassuring
        me to remember that I don't only love all these physical things or even
        what they make me feel. It is the connection, the love, the passion, the
        consideration and the respect we share for one another that I love most.
        (Haha I love the love.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I think these were a couple more reasons than anticipated, but I could
        go on and on. If I had to count it all up, I'd still be here tomorrow,
        and so I just want to name one more:
      </p>
      <p>
        I love you because at the beginning of our relationship, you never
        moaned or reacted much when I would blow you, and since I told you that
        made me insecure, you always gave me a reaction and it made me want to
        go more and do better. I love you because I love being on my knees and
        taking you as deep as humanly possible (literally to the point my body
        couldn't take more), and would still want more. I love you because I
        cannot imagine a hotter scenario than those in that shower in my old
        place and because throughout all the times I've done this in my life,
        you are the only times I've ever swallowed or done it without a barrier
        between us. I love you because when we do harder positions or you think
        it's too much for you, you always ask and don't just assume. I love you
        because I don't have to fake it with you, and I don't have to fear it
        either.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think at this point neither one of us can stand the phrase "I love
        you" anymore, but I feel the last paragraph was very important.
      </p>
      <p>
        To end our seven month anniversary letter, I want to say that I don't
        love you. I LAB*
      </p>
      <p>In lab,</p>
      <p>Your Bubli</p>
      <p>*PS: MORE!!!</p>
