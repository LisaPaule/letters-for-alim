      <h1>Day 2 Post-Break Up</h1>
      <p>
        Today is my second day of us having broken up, and after yesterday’s
        conversation I thought a lot. I thought about whether this is the right
        thing to do after all, whether we have a chance, whether you even still
        love me, whether we will still love each other in whatever future we
        find each other in again. And I realised a lot more things.
      </p>
      <p>
        For one, I realised that being apart is not about taking a break. It’s
        about creating distance to see clearly. And that while maybe I convinced
        myself I was thinking clearly, I might have not, and might have simply
        convinced myself that your presence was the key to clarity and not the
        thing that taints it. Coming to that realisation was hard, especially
        following our conversation, but it doesn’t mean I was wrong entirely. It
        just means you were right in this, partially at least.
      </p>
      <p>
        I realised that we only have a chance if we’re able to grow as people. I
        think there was a lot of issues we had in the relationship because we
        didn’t accept each other fully for who the other person was, or we made
        the other person feel not accepted/not taken
        seriously/disrespected/ridiculed/etc.. You always said as long as there
        is respect left, it’s salvagable. I wonder whether you thinking it’s not
        fixable is due to a lack of respect. I have a lot of questions. Not
        because I don’t understand how we got here, but just because I want to
        talk to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I realised yesterday that the only reason we are where we are right now
        (good terms with the possibility of a future) is because of you. Because
        I know when I need someone desperately, you’re not gone, just further
        away. And you know when you need someone desperately, I’ll always be
        here too, even though you won’t reach out to me. I only archived you
        yesterday. And now I open WhatsApp just to check whether someone texted
        me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to think of a future between us so badly, but I can’t. Because
        now, we’re individuals and I don’t know who’ll we’ll grow up to be. But
        if we grow up and heal to be people that are compatible, and if in two
        weeks/one month/however many months it takes until we talk again about
        this, we don’t start to hate each other, I strongly believe we still
        have a chance. Because I know you still love me. And I know I still love
        you. I know I won’t fall out of love with you by then, and I hope you
        won’t either. You said yesterday that you are moving on and I should
        too. I said I don’t want to and that I won’t. I was wrong. I am too, I’m
        just doing it differently. I wonder whether when looking at it now, who
        loves the other more? The one who wanted to fight because they knew they
        could make it, even though they might have not, or the one who wanted to
        move apart because they knew they couldn’t make it if they stayed, even
        though they might have. I hope I’ll never be able to answer that
        question. Simply because I think at the end of it, it was mutual love.
        It is mutual love.
      </p>
      <p>
        The question of whether we will still love each other in whatever future
        we find each other in again is a hard one. I hope we do. I hope we can
        laugh about this in 5 years, and I hope we look back at it as a
        successfull breakup. (Because otherwise none of this was worth it.) But
        right now, I don’t see it yet. Right now, all I do is miss you and yearn
        for your laugh/your touch/your smell (I stole some of your perfume
        btw)/your attention/your care/you. Right now, I miss how you drove your
        finger over the curve of my nose and I miss being called Bubu, and I
        look for you any place I go. Right now, I wish I could see your location
        to make sure you’re okay, and I wish I could text you good morning and
        ask you how you slept, and I wish I could call you good night and ask
        you about your day and when you tell me all about the new plane you’re
        flying or the interesting new programming skill/programme you learned, I
        wish I could nod along like I understand what you’re talking about.
        Right now, I just wish we could go back to three months ago, to when I
        came back from EYP and we fell in bed and hugged like the we weren’t
        part of this world and we were special.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I know going back to what we used to be won’t help us and won’t be
        good in the long run, so I’m giving this a chance (like I have a
        choice). I hope one day, when I look back at this, or we do, we can say
        I’m/we are proud of ourselves/us. If not, then maybe another day. I love
        you and till we see each other again, my love.
