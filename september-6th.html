      <p>
        I forgive you. I had a conversation with Adelina and I thought a lot,
        and this is dramatic and stupid. But I forgive you.

        I'm a bit butthurt you removed me from your Youtube Premium, and it's
        hard to realise it was so easy for you to cut me from your life when you
        were so unwilling to cut her from it when I'd asked you to, but I am
        getting over you.
