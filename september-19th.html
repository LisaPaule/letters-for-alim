      <h1>Day 24 Post-Break Up</h1>
      <p>
        Missing you isn't just about missing the relationship. It's having a
        dream with you, and feeling comfort again for the first time in a month,
        and it's waking up with a pit in my stomach and tears in my eyes. It's
        having Duku still on my bed and the white pillow you cried into, but not
        being able to touch them because it hurts. It's opening your contact
        when I achieved something and realising you don't care anymore. It's
        writing these letters for you that you might never read just to keep you
        close.
      </p>
      <p>
        My biggest fear is that I die with this pain in my chest. That one day I
        wake up and say "Fuck it" and when I reach out to you because I need you
        to know I still love you, you're just gone. That one day you wake up and
        say "Today's the day" and you reach out to me, and I'm already gone.
      </p>
      <p>
        I fear that when I lay there and I wait for the darkness to finally
        swallow me whole, you don't feel a thing. That you have let go off me,
        and that you don't even remember how it was when you held me close.
      </p>
      <p>
        I fear that I'll miss you forever. That in 30 years when all is done and
        we're so far apart there's no possibility of an us, I'll still miss you.
        And that you won't even remember my name.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope you love her and I hope she loves you too. I hope you think of me
        when you're alone and I hope you look for me in her. I hope you find me
        sometimes somewhere in her jokes, her laugh, her opinions and who she
        wants to be to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've wanted to call you so often it's ridiculous. But I know you don't
        want to hear from me. I am trying to respect your wishes for once, and
        it hurts. Our eight month anniversary would've been on Tuesday. I'll
        blow the candles out for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I won't forget how you cried into that pillow, Alim. I won't forget how
        you held me when I cried. We did love each other. And I still love you,
        so if I ever got a chance to speak to you again, I'd ask you whether we
        can try again. And I'd promise this time, to do it right. And if I get
        to have another chance, I'd cherish you. I promise. I'd see you for who
        you are and I'd love every piece of you.
      </p>
      <p>
        So please, if we ever get to have another chance, let me tell you
        something. No matter how close you are, if you were closer, I'd kiss
        you.
