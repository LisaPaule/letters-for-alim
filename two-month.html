      <h1>Happy Two Month Anniversary!!!</h1>
      <p>Dear dudu,</p>
      <p>
        It's been two months! Yay! We're already 1/546 through the timeline of
        this beautiful thing we're building–and somehow it already feels like
        forever in the best way possible. I don’t think either of us could be
        any happier (well, maybe slightly happier if we didn't include blowjobs,
        the number of times I’ve cooked, and how many cuddles I’ve received
        (insert sad emoji)). But hey, who’s keeping score? Every day I wake up,
        I want you. All of you. I want your hands in mine, your lips against
        mine, and that look in your eyes that makes me melt every single time. I
        want us tangled together, forgetting time, wrapped in soft sheets and
        each other’s heat. You know exactly how to make me feel like the only
        person in the world. But beyond all the hot, sex-related thoughts I am
        having right now—and god, there’s a lot of them—I keep dreaming of
        everything we’ll build.
      </p>
      <p>
        I dream of a pretty apartment that smells like coffee, brownies and you.
        Minimalist, a little chaotic in the corners because we’re living in it,
        really living. We’ll fight over which way the knives should go in the
        drawer or who should do the dishes, then make up in bed an hour later.
        Three little humans. Jen—our fierce, funny girl (who’ll insist we stop
        calling her Jennifer by the time she’s 7). She's just like her mother.
        Ilya—soft-hearted but sharp-eyed and cut-throat like his father. And our
        littlest boy, name still TBD, but I already love the way I imagine him
        crawling into our bed in the morning, tangling himself between us,
        ruining MY cuddle time but being soo cute, I can't even be mad. I dream
        of waking up with you every day, making breakfast for us five, getting
        ready for the day, loving the life we've built. I dream of soccer
        practices, parent-teacher conferences, movie nights, game nights, all
        kinds of nights, road trips (you drive), eating out, eating in, cooking,
        dancing in the kitchen to Prince Royce, watching our favourite shows
        together. I dream of soo many beautiful moments that I want to share
        with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        A wedding. God, a beautiful wedding. Your eyes when you see me. The kiss
        that changes everything and nothing all at once. A beautiful bride and
        the most handsome groom the world has ever seen. Dancing all night,
        drunk on champagne and each other. A home that grows with us. A friend
        group from uni—our people, our chaos, our laughs. Moving from our
        beautiful apartment into our beautiful house, both being our homes
        because I share them with you. Always you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Loving each other forever sounds like a fairytale, but with you, it
        feels like the only possible truth. I want to be the 2% that make it.
        And I think we can be, if we go the way we have. If we love, respect,
        want the best for and believe in each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I don't mean it in that delusional, teenage-love kind of way. I mean
        it in the
        I-know-there'll-be-tough-times,-but-I-think-we-can-withstand-them kind
        of way. I mean it in the
        there'll-be-times-I-want-to-kill-you,-but-I-can't-because-I-love-you
        kind of way. I mean it in the
        there'll-come-a-day-you'll-be-mad-with-me,-but-forgive-me-because-you-love-me
        kind of way. I mean it in the
        I-love-you-soo-much-I-can't-imagine-not-loving-you-anymore kind of way.
        I think I've brought my point across.
      </p>
      <p>So let me get back to the main point (a repeating pattern hahaha).</p>
      <p>Happy two months, baby. Here’s to the other 545.</p>
      <p>In love,</p>
      <p>Your bubu</p>
