      <h1>Day 67 Post-Break Up</h1>
      <p>
        I don't want to give up on you. I want to just go ahead and be good, but
        I don't know whether you want to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last week, I felt like when I asked you to meet and get to know each
        other again, you were more like "Okay" than really very happy or excited
        for it. It took a lot in me to get to that point, and I have been
        thinking about it for a long time. So I'm happy I finally did it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I miss you. I just want us to be mature, talk things out, focus on our
        goals, worry about our future, be all about each other and our
        successes, grow up together, love each other right, heal our inner child
        together, do the little cute things together, enjoy the little moments,
        have long deep conversations with each other, love each other
        unconditionally and never fall out of it again, because I don't wanna
        lose you and I miss you.
      </p>
      <p>
        All I want right now is to lay in your arms, hug you, play with your
        hair, wear your hoodie, kiss you and fall asleep while cuddling. I miss
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I never realised how much you felt like home to me until I found myself
        sitting in an ICE thinking about how much I wish I was travelling all
        the way to see you. I found myself thinking about how much I wish you
        were with me in so many moments, it feels easier to count moments I
        haven't thought of you. I want to experience every adventure of life I
        go through with you my by side.
      </p>
      <p>
        The saying "home is whenever I'm with you" has never been more clear to
        me. You are my home, and I am homesick without you.
      </p>
      <p>I love you, Alim.</p>
