      <h1>Day 67 Post-Break Up</h1>
      <p>
        I give up on you, not out of anger this time, but because of the
        understanding that you just aren't my person. I've went out of my way to
        help you, to defend you and support you, and I've not gotten anything in
        return.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the past months, I've held on to this person I believed you were,
        but I've now understood that you're not. Maybe you are who I've been
        told you are, maybe you are partially who I believed you to be, but you
        definitely aren't who I thought I loved, and who deserved someone to
        fight for them. And so I give up.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is my last letter to you. I'll leave you in 2025, leave you in my
        past, and I'll forgive myself for having wasted my time, money,
        potential, love on someone who would never and maybe can't do the same.
      </p>
      <p>Bye, Alim.</p>
