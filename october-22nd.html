      <h1>Day 57 Post-Break Up</h1>
      <p>
        Today is one of those days it feels harder than on others. I woke up
        today, and I missed you. It's 3am and I'm crying because I miss you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have no one to talk to. No one I want to bother with this any longer,
        no one who understands. You were my best friend, so now I'm left here
        all on my own.
      </p>
      <p>I'm not saying that to guilt-trip you, I promise.</p>
      <p>
        I've gotten to a point where every single one of my friends who I've
        spoken to about this has come to the conclusion that you are the love of
        my life, and that'll hurt for a lot longer still.
      </p>
      <p>
        But no one talks about how hard it is to pretend you've moved on when
        you haven't. How embarassing it is to prove you right. How belittling it
        feels that after 2 whole months, I still love you like the very first
        moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lingering pain of not being over you hurts more than when you first
        left.
      </p>
      <p>
        I knew round about my birthday that you'd either be my biggest
        heartbreak or the person I'll marry. I think you can guess who you
        turned out to be for me. And it breaks my fucking heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shortly after we broke up, my cousin asked me what you were like, and it
        was such a hard question to answer. But I know now. You're like all the
        love I've ever poured out into the world finally found its way back to
        me, wrapped itself in human form and held me close. You are who I miss
        in a room full of people. You are who I think of when I'm scared. You
        are who I crave on a random monday morning, and who I miss every day
        before I go to sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don't understand the kind of love I have for you. It's the kinda
        love that has listened to more Youngboy Songs this year just in the past
        two months than any other artist. It's the kinda love that bought you a
        birthday gift even after we broke up, the kinda love that holds a space
        in every part of my body and soul for you, just in case you choose an
        unexpected entry way.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it's also the kind of love that doesn't just vanish or go away. It's
        the kind that feels like you can't move past it any other way.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I'm not saying that is what I'm going to do, but here are the
        instructions I have for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your box is in my drawer with the books. On the lowest shelf. Take it,
        and keep it please. Your Valentine's letter is in my wallet in the depth
        of the back wall, take it and bury it with me. My love is kneet into
        every crevice of that room, make sure they package it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, the cigs and your birthday gift are behind the Van Gogh Postcards
        in my desk. If you can't find them, ask Nelli.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want it, the perfume I used to wear with you is in my toilet bag
        on the desk. I never wore it after we broke up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just know I loved you til the very last moment, probably still do from
        the afterlife.
      </p>
      <p>Goodbye, my love</p>
