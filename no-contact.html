        <h1>Day 1 Post-Break Up</h1>
        <p>
          We broke up yesterday. I don’t think I’ve fully grasped it yet. I miss
          you already. I know I need to start reflecting and healing, so that’s
          what I plan to do with this journal. I want to be productive and
          continue to learn the skills I’ve been trying to learn for the past
          couple months. I want to make money and work, so that I can build a
          life for myself, which you are part of. I want to become a better
          person so that I start to feel deserving of the kind of love you give
          me. I want to become a clearer person so that I can start to love you
          the way you need to be loved. I have goals and I will try my very best
          to succeed in them, so that we have a chance.
        </p>
        <p>Right now, I feel anger, sadness, fear and longing.</p>
        <p>
          Anger because I’m angry at you for suggesting to break up, thinking
          there was a possibility I’d say no. Anger because I’m angry at myself
          for being too proud and not being able to be vulnerable when I don’t
          see your face. Anger because I know we could have managed to do it
          differently and we didn’t because we gave up. Anger because I know in
          a month, I’ll still be angry about how we decided to go about this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sadness because I’m disappointed in the both of us. Sadness because I
          feel like if you loved me more and you wanted to be with me more, we
          might have had a chance, but I know that because of how much you loved
          me and how much you wanted to be with me, you think this is the only
          way we have a chance. Sadness because I wish I saw it that way too and
          I wish you saw it my way. Sadness because I miss you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fear because nothing is clear. Because I don’t know whether you’ll
          wake up tomorrow and decide to move on past a point of rekindling.
          Fear because I don’t know whether tomorrow is the day I see nothing
          left anymore. Fear because the future might be the most beautiful
          thing imaginable, or the most hurtful Fear because I love you so
          incredibly much, and now I have nowhere to put this love into, no
          vessel, nowhere to place it. Fear because what if we don’t find back
          to one another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Longing because you are you and I am me. I’ve longed for you since
          January 2025 and I plan to long for you til January 2100. Longing
          because I’ve never felt loved the way I felt loved by you. Longing
          because you are the most beautiful person in this world and I have not
          felt this love towards another person. Longing because when I think of
          the fact that I have lost the privilege of your attention and your
          love, your touch and your caress, my heart physically hurts. Longing
          because if I could do anything right now to get you back and to feel
          happy with you again, I would. I would literally do anything in this
          world, may it be to start a World War, just to lie in your arms until
          death does me part.
        </p>
        <p>
          I miss you. And I love you. And I’ll miss you tomorrow and the day
          after that and the day after that. And I’ll love you tomorrow and the
          day after that. And I’ll miss you for every day after that, and love
          you for just as long. You are my love and even if I let you go
          physically, will let you go mentally, I’ll never let you go
          emotionally because you settled in my heart and you can’t just pack up
          and move out from there.

        <h1>Day 2 Post-Break Up</h1>
        <p>
          Today is my second day of us having broken up, and after yesterday’s
          conversation I thought a lot. I thought about whether this is the
          right thing to do after all, whether we have a chance, whether you
          even still love me, whether we will still love each other in whatever
          future we find each other in again. And I realised a lot more things.
        </p>
        <p>
          For one, I realised that being apart is not about taking a break. It’s
          about creating distance to see clearly. And that while maybe I
          convinced myself I was thinking clearly, I might have not, and might
          have simply convinced myself that your presence was the key to clarity
          and not the thing that taints it. Coming to that realisation was hard,
          especially following our conversation, but it doesn’t mean I was wrong
          entirely. It just means you were right in this, partially at least.
        </p>
        <p>
          I realised that we only have a chance if we’re able to grow as people.
          I think there was a lot of issues we had in the relationship because
          we didn’t accept each other fully for who the other person was, or we
          made the other person feel not accepted/not taken
          seriously/disrespected/ridiculed/etc.. You always said as long as
          there is respect left, it’s salvagable. I wonder whether you thinking
          it’s not fixable is due to a lack of respect. I have a lot of
          questions. Not because I don’t understand how we got here, but just
          because I want to talk to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          I realised yesterday that the only reason we are where we are right
          now (good terms with the possibility of a future) is because of you.
          Because I know when I need someone desperately, you’re not gone, just
          further away. And you know when you need someone desperately, I’ll
          always be here too, even though you won’t reach out to me. I only
          archived you yesterday. And now I open WhatsApp just to check whether
          someone texted me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to think of a future between us so badly, but I can’t. Because
          now, we’re individuals and I don’t know who’ll we’ll grow up to be.
          But if we grow up and heal to be people that are compatible, and if in
          two weeks/one month/however many months it takes until we talk again
          about this, we don’t start to hate each other, I strongly believe we
          still have a chance. Because I know you still love me. And I know I
          still love you. I know I won’t fall out of love with you by then, and
          I hope you won’t either. You said yesterday that you are moving on and
          I should too. I said I don’t want to and that I won’t. I was wrong. I
          am too, I’m just doing it differently. I wonder whether when looking
          at it now, who loves the other more? The one who wanted to fight
          because they knew they could make it, even though they might have not,
          or the one who wanted to move apart because they knew they couldn’t
          make it if they stayed, even though they might have. I hope I’ll never
          be able to answer that question. Simply because I think at the end of
          it, it was mutual love. It is mutual love.
        </p>
        <p>
          The question of whether we will still love each other in whatever
          future we find each other in again is a hard one. I hope we do. I hope
          we can laugh about this in 5 years, and I hope we look back at it as a
          successfull breakup. (Because otherwise none of this was worth it.)
          But right now, I don’t see it yet. Right now, all I do is miss you and
          yearn for your laugh/your touch/your smell (I stole some of your
          perfume btw)/your attention/your care/you. Right now, I miss how you
          drove your finger over the curve of my nose and I miss being called
          Bubu, and I look for you any place I go. Right now, I wish I could see
          your location to make sure you’re okay, and I wish I could text you
          good morning and ask you how you slept, and I wish I could call you
          good night and ask you about your day and when you tell me all about
          the new plane you’re flying or the interesting new programming
          skill/programme you learned, I wish I could nod along like I
          understand what you’re talking about. Right now, I just wish we could
          go back to three months ago, to when I came back from EYP and we fell
          in bed and hugged like the we weren’t part of this world and we were
          special.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I know going back to what we used to be won’t help us and won’t be
          good in the long run, so I’m giving this a chance (like I have a
          choice). I hope one day, when I look back at this, or we do, we can
          say I’m/we are proud of ourselves/us. If not, then maybe another day.
          I love you and till we see each other again, my love.

        <h1>Day 3 Post-Break Up</h1>
        <p>
          It’s day three and it doesn’t seem to be getting any easier. In my
          head, I always wonder whether you’re thinking of me too in this very
          moment, whether you miss me and my laugh or my stupid jokes. I think
          about how just four days ago, we still said good morning to each other
          and how a week ago, I was so excited to finally see you again after a
          month. It seems I miss you more now. Because I realise that you’re not
          here and that you are part of my daily routine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The uncertainty is killing me. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know
          whether I should reach out to you already, because I don’t want to not
          talk to you for a month, but I know you asked for space. I don’t want
          to invalidate your feelings and force myself onto you, but I don’t
          want to pull far enough away from you to maybe not be able to find
          back to each other. I don’t want to wait very long because we don’t
          have the time to not fix at least some of our issues before November
          when you have to start studying. I don’t want to not wait because I
          trust you and I know we need the space. I’m annoyed because it feels
          impossible to give you the space.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to get into the car and drive to Göttingen, force you to speak
          with me, fix it. But I know it’s the wrong thing to do. I want to give
          us space to heal and reflect for the future. But it feels like the
          wrong thing to do. We are stuck between a hard place and a rock. We
          don’t have many options, but we do have some. I’m sitting and thinking
          of those, trying to see how one can make them reality and if we’d even
          be happy, if they became reality, but doing that doesn’t change
          anything if we can’t talk. I want to be friends and share parts of our
          lives with one another, but I don’t know whether we can do that
          without you feeling like I’m constantly trying to rekindle already and
          without me subconsciously actually doing that.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m worried about you and how you’re doing mentally, but I don’t get
          the right to do that anymore because I lost that privilege. I sit and
          read through our breakup chat, and I don’t understand how it happened.
          I don’t understand how I let it happen so carelessly. I don’t know
          whether you wanted me to fight for us and I didn’t when you needed me
          to. I know I wanted you to fight for us, but I didn’t give you the
          time to do that. I know I rushed you and I wish I hadn’t. But I know
          if I hadn’t, I’d be unhappy now too. I know there weren’t many good
          options, if any, but I also know that because we gave up, we won’t
          know what could’ve been if we hadn’t. At least now after breaking up,
          I know what it feels like not being able to sleep, not being able to
          eat, constantly having you on my mind, not being able to do nothing.
          And it hurts. I don’t think anybody deserves to feel like this. And I
          could’ve told you earlier that this is what it’s gonna feel like, but
          when you asked me whether we should break up, when you suggested for
          us to break up, there was no way I could’ve said I don’t want to.
          There was no way for me to keep you in this unhappy place you were in,
          force you to stay in a place you were unwilling to be in, a place you
          thought you’d be hurting me in. But Alim, this hurts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wonder whether we’ll get another chance. I hope you were right when
          you said: ”We will have more than enough chances to hug in the future
          if we are lucky, but right now we must settle our minds first for a
          while.” I’m sorry I didn’t reply to you when you said that. I was in
          my head and trying not to break down packing my things. It wasn’t
          because I don’t agree. I don’t want to think of an ’if we’re
          unlucky’-time, and so I won’t, but I just don’t know anything anymore.
          I want to talk to you, even as just friends, but I can’t because I
          feel like I shouldn’t, but I want to. I’m torn and it’s the hardest
          thing I’ve ever had to do. I unarchived you because whenever I open
          WhatsApp and see a notification in my Archived, my heart jumps and I
          know that’s gonna become very unhealthy in not too long, so you’re
          unarchived.
        </p>
        <p>
          The question I’ll answer today to reflect is: What are specific
          moments I replay in our relationship? Why those? It’s a question that
          is hard to answer because in order to answer it I have to actually
          think about what I’m sad about and not just that I’m sad. I often
          think about the first moments in our relationship, where we went on
          dates or we talked. I think about that day after my German IO when we
          went on a walk to the hospital and you were there for me, you held me
          while I cried. I think about that day a lot actually. I also think a
          lot about the pride I felt when I came back down from the stage at
          Bunter Abend, and how we held hands in the pubes and my heart was
          skipping out of my chest. I think about how I forgot my keys in your
          wallet and you came 20 minutes later all the way to my place just to
          bring me my keys and you weren’t even mad. I think about us laughing
          when I dropped the pizza in my old place. I think about every time I
          fell asleep on top of you watching a Fener game, or that one time in
          March where we were playing against Gala and I was wide awake,
          complaining about the ref and we were laughing so hard. I think about
          every time we’d play fight while brushing teeth or wrestle on the bed,
          and I think about how I beat you every time. I think about how happy
          you were when I gifted you something, and how happy I was when you
          gifted me too. I think about how we were happy. Sometimes, I randomly
          think about that time not too long ago when we died laughing in bed
          because you said ”Imagine Elias told me he’s pregnant” and how we
          laughed for 10 minutes straight and after that you said, ”I love your
          cute laugh” and my heart jumped. Or our bi-weekly competition of ”Can
          I tell you a secret?” I think about ”Matcha and Missionary”.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then sometimes I think about a quote of yours you said back in
          May: ”No one has ever learned their lesson by simply being forgiven
          for their wrongdoings.” What a loaded thing to say, but a very
          truthful thing as well. You’re right. And I’m holding on to that as
          well. Maybe we would’ve never learned our lesson in what we need to do
          and change in our relationship if we had simply forgiven ourselves and
          each other for our wrongdoings within the relationship, and this is us
          trying to force ourselves back into the reality that is the
          consequences of our actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s day 2 of no-contact and we’ll see how long this goes.
          Technically, I have another 20 days of that ahead of me, but I’m not
          sure whether that’s what you want or whether you want me to text you.
          We’ll see. I don’t know when we’ll get to a point where you’ll think
          I’m clear enough in my head for a conversation. What I do know though
          is that when we do get there and we do talk, it will be in person.
          That is something I’ve already reflected on. A lot of things would be
          different, if we had done them in person – including our breakup. But
          it’s too late now to reminisce over what could’ve been if, so I’ll be
          focusing on what has to happen in order for. So yeah, once again, I
          love you and till we see each other again, Dudu.
