        <h1>Day 1 Post-Break Up</h1>
        <p>
          We broke up yesterday. I don’t think I’ve fully grasped it yet. I miss
          you already. I know I need to start reflecting and healing, so that’s
          what I plan to do with this journal. I want to be productive and
          continue to learn the skills I’ve been trying to learn for the past
          couple months. I want to make money and work, so that I can build a
          life for myself, which you are part of. I want to become a better
          person so that I start to feel deserving of the kind of love you give
          me. I want to become a clearer person so that I can start to love you
          the way you need to be loved. I have goals and I will try my very best
          to succeed in them, so that we have a chance.
        </p>
        <p>Right now, I feel anger, sadness, fear and longing.</p>
        <p>
          Anger because I’m angry at you for suggesting to break up, thinking
          there was a possibility I’d say no. Anger because I’m angry at myself
          for being too proud and not being able to be vulnerable when I don’t
          see your face. Anger because I know we could have managed to do it
          differently and we didn’t because we gave up. Anger because I know in
          a month, I’ll still be angry about how we decided to go about this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sadness because I’m disappointed in the both of us. Sadness because I
          feel like if you loved me more and you wanted to be with me more, we
          might have had a chance, but I know that because of how much you loved
          me and how much you wanted to be with me, you think this is the only
          way we have a chance. Sadness because I wish I saw it that way too and
          I wish you saw it my way. Sadness because I miss you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fear because nothing is clear. Because I don’t know whether you’ll
          wake up tomorrow and decide to move on past a point of rekindling.
          Fear because I don’t know whether tomorrow is the day I see nothing
          left anymore. Fear because the future might be the most beautiful
          thing imaginable, or the most hurtful Fear because I love you so
          incredibly much, and now I have nowhere to put this love into, no
          vessel, nowhere to place it. Fear because what if we don’t find back
          to one another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Longing because you are you and I am me. I’ve longed for you since
          January 2025 and I plan to long for you til January 2100. Longing
          because I’ve never felt loved the way I felt loved by you. Longing
          because you are the most beautiful person in this world and I have not
          felt this love towards another person. Longing because when I think of
          the fact that I have lost the privilege of your attention and your
          love, your touch and your caress, my heart physically hurts. Longing
          because if I could do anything right now to get you back and to feel
          happy with you again, I would. I would literally do anything in this
          world, may it be to start a World War, just to lie in your arms until
          death does me part.
        </p>
        <p>
          I miss you. And I love you. And I’ll miss you tomorrow and the day
          after that and the day after that. And I’ll love you tomorrow and the
          day after that. And I’ll miss you for every day after that, and love
          you for just as long. You are my love and even if I let you go
          physically, will let you go mentally, I’ll never let you go
          emotionally because you settled in my heart and you can’t just pack up
          and move out from there.

        <h1>Day 2 Post-Break Up</h1>
        <p>
          Today is my second day of us having broken up, and after yesterday’s
          conversation I thought a lot. I thought about whether this is the
          right thing to do after all, whether we have a chance, whether you
          even still love me, whether we will still love each other in whatever
          future we find each other in again. And I realised a lot more things.
        </p>
        <p>
          For one, I realised that being apart is not about taking a break. It’s
          about creating distance to see clearly. And that while maybe I
          convinced myself I was thinking clearly, I might have not, and might
          have simply convinced myself that your presence was the key to clarity
          and not the thing that taints it. Coming to that realisation was hard,
          especially following our conversation, but it doesn’t mean I was wrong
          entirely. It just means you were right in this, partially at least.
        </p>
        <p>
          I realised that we only have a chance if we’re able to grow as people.
          I think there was a lot of issues we had in the relationship because
          we didn’t accept each other fully for who the other person was, or we
          made the other person feel not accepted/not taken
          seriously/disrespected/ridiculed/etc.. You always said as long as
          there is respect left, it’s salvagable. I wonder whether you thinking
          it’s not fixable is due to a lack of respect. I have a lot of
          questions. Not because I don’t understand how we got here, but just
          because I want to talk to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          I realised yesterday that the only reason we are where we are right
          now (good terms with the possibility of a future) is because of you.
          Because I know when I need someone desperately, you’re not gone, just
          further away. And you know when you need someone desperately, I’ll
          always be here too, even though you won’t reach out to me. I only
          archived you yesterday. And now I open WhatsApp just to check whether
          someone texted me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to think of a future between us so badly, but I can’t. Because
          now, we’re individuals and I don’t know who’ll we’ll grow up to be.
          But if we grow up and heal to be people that are compatible, and if in
          two weeks/one month/however many months it takes until we talk again
          about this, we don’t start to hate each other, I strongly believe we
          still have a chance. Because I know you still love me. And I know I
          still love you. I know I won’t fall out of love with you by then, and
          I hope you won’t either. You said yesterday that you are moving on and
          I should too. I said I don’t want to and that I won’t. I was wrong. I
          am too, I’m just doing it differently. I wonder whether when looking
          at it now, who loves the other more? The one who wanted to fight
          because they knew they could make it, even though they might have not,
          or the one who wanted to move apart because they knew they couldn’t
          make it if they stayed, even though they might have. I hope I’ll never
          be able to answer that question. Simply because I think at the end of
          it, it was mutual love. It is mutual love.
        </p>
        <p>
          The question of whether we will still love each other in whatever
          future we find each other in again is a hard one. I hope we do. I hope
          we can laugh about this in 5 years, and I hope we look back at it as a
          successfull breakup. (Because otherwise none of this was worth it.)
          But right now, I don’t see it yet. Right now, all I do is miss you and
          yearn for your laugh/your touch/your smell (I stole some of your
          perfume btw)/your attention/your care/you. Right now, I miss how you
          drove your finger over the curve of my nose and I miss being called
          Bubu, and I look for you any place I go. Right now, I wish I could see
          your location to make sure you’re okay, and I wish I could text you
          good morning and ask you how you slept, and I wish I could call you
          good night and ask you about your day and when you tell me all about
          the new plane you’re flying or the interesting new programming
          skill/programme you learned, I wish I could nod along like I
          understand what you’re talking about. Right now, I just wish we could
          go back to three months ago, to when I came back from EYP and we fell
          in bed and hugged like the we weren’t part of this world and we were
          special.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I know going back to what we used to be won’t help us and won’t be
          good in the long run, so I’m giving this a chance (like I have a
          choice). I hope one day, when I look back at this, or we do, we can
          say I’m/we are proud of ourselves/us. If not, then maybe another day.
          I love you and till we see each other again, my love.

        <p class="textopen">
          There’s something about knowing I’ve played a part in your happiness
          that’s impossible to put into simple words. It’s more than pride—it’s
          this deep, steady warmth that settles in me, knowing that I could give
          you a reason to smile, to laugh, to feel lighter. I never take that
          for granted.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          When I see that look in your eyes—the one you get when you’re happy in
          a way that’s just for us—it’s the best kind of confirmation that I’m
          doing something right. I notice it every time: the little curve of
          your mouth when you’re trying not to grin too hard, the way your
          shoulders drop like you’ve just let go of something heavy, the quiet
          ease that settles into your voice. Those moments make me want to keep
          showing up for you in ways that make you feel that way again and
          again.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          I don’t think it’s about grand gestures or perfect words. Sometimes
          it’s something small—a joke that lands just right, a meal you love, a
          moment where I really listened and understood. Sometimes it’s just me
          being there when you needed someone. But no matter how small, if it
          made your day better, then it’s worth it.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          I want to be someone who adds to your life, not just someone who’s
          there while you’re living it. I want to give you more days that you
          remember not just because they were good, but because they made you
          feel seen, appreciated, and loved. And when I realize I’ve been part
          of making that happen, it’s one of the most rewarding feelings in the
          world.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          So when you’re happy and I’m the reason, know that I don’t take it
          lightly. I carry that feeling with me, and it becomes my reason, too.
          Your joy fuels mine, and it makes me want to keep finding ways to make
          you feel this way—not because I have to, but because I can’t imagine
          wanting anything more than to see you like that.
        </p>
