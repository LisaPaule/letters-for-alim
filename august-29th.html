      <h1>Day 3 Post-Break Up</h1>
      <p>
        It’s day three and it doesn’t seem to be getting any easier. In my head,
        I always wonder whether you’re thinking of me too in this very moment,
        whether you miss me and my laugh or my stupid jokes. I think about how
        just four days ago, we still said good morning to each other and how a
        week ago, I was so excited to finally see you again after a month. It
        seems I miss you more now. Because I realise that you’re not here and
        that you are part of my daily routine.
      </p>
      <p>
        The uncertainty is killing me. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know
        whether I should reach out to you already, because I don’t want to not
        talk to you for a month, but I know you asked for space. I don’t want to
        invalidate your feelings and force myself onto you, but I don’t want to
        pull far enough away from you to maybe not be able to find back to each
        other. I don’t want to wait very long because we don’t have the time to
        not fix at least some of our issues before November when you have to
        start studying. I don’t want to not wait because I trust you and I know
        we need the space. I’m annoyed because it feels impossible to give you
        the space.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to get into the car and drive to Göttingen, force you to speak
        with me, fix it. But I know it’s the wrong thing to do. I want to give
        us space to heal and reflect for the future. But it feels like the wrong
        thing to do. We are stuck between a hard place and a rock. We don’t have
        many options, but we do have some. I’m sitting and thinking of those,
        trying to see how one can make them reality and if we’d even be happy,
        if they became reality, but doing that doesn’t change anything if we
        can’t talk. I want to be friends and share parts of our lives with one
        another, but I don’t know whether we can do that without you feeling
        like I’m constantly trying to rekindle already and without me
        subconsciously actually doing that.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m worried about you and how you’re doing mentally, but I don’t get the
        right to do that anymore because I lost that privilege. I sit and read
        through our breakup chat, and I don’t understand how it happened. I
        don’t understand how I let it happen so carelessly. I don’t know whether
        you wanted me to fight for us and I didn’t when you needed me to. I know
        I wanted you to fight for us, but I didn’t give you the time to do that.
        I know I rushed you and I wish I hadn’t. But I know if I hadn’t, I’d be
        unhappy now too. I know there weren’t many good options, if any, but I
        also know that because we gave up, we won’t know what could’ve been if
        we hadn’t. At least now after breaking up, I know what it feels like not
        being able to sleep, not being able to eat, constantly having you on my
        mind, not being able to do nothing. And it hurts. I don’t think anybody
        deserves to feel like this. And I could’ve told you earlier that this is
        what it’s gonna feel like, but when you asked me whether we should break
        up, when you suggested for us to break up, there was no way I could’ve
        said I don’t want to. There was no way for me to keep you in this
        unhappy place you were in, force you to stay in a place you were
        unwilling to be in, a place you thought you’d be hurting me in. But
        Alim, this hurts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wonder whether we’ll get another chance. I hope you were right when
        you said: ”We will have more than enough chances to hug in the future if
        we are lucky, but right now we must settle our minds first for a while.”
        I’m sorry I didn’t reply to you when you said that. I was in my head and
        trying not to break down packing my things. It wasn’t because I don’t
        agree. I don’t want to think of an ’if we’re unlucky’-time, and so I
        won’t, but I just don’t know anything anymore. I want to talk to you,
        even as just friends, but I can’t because I feel like I shouldn’t, but I
        want to. I’m torn and it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. I
        unarchived you because whenever I open WhatsApp and see a notification
        in my Archived, my heart jumps and I know that’s gonna become very
        unhealthy in not too long, so you’re unarchived.
      </p>
      <p>
        The question I’ll answer today to reflect is: What are specific moments
        I replay in our relationship? Why those? It’s a question that is hard to
        answer because in order to answer it I have to actually think about what
        I’m sad about and not just that I’m sad. I often think about the first
        moments in our relationship, where we went on dates or we talked. I
        think about that day after my German IO when we went on a walk to the
        hospital and you were there for me, you held me while I cried. I think
        about that day a lot actually. I also think a lot about the pride I felt
        when I came back down from the stage at Bunter Abend, and how we held
        hands in the pubes and my heart was skipping out of my chest. I think
        about how I forgot my keys in your wallet and you came 20 minutes later
        all the way to my place just to bring me my keys and you weren’t even
        mad. I think about us laughing when I dropped the pizza in my old place.
        I think about every time I fell asleep on top of you watching a Fener
        game, or that one time in March where we were playing against Gala and I
        was wide awake, complaining about the ref and we were laughing so hard.
        I think about every time we’d play fight while brushing teeth or wrestle
        on the bed, and I think about how I beat you every time. I think about
        how happy you were when I gifted you something, and how happy I was when
        you gifted me too. I think about how we were happy. Sometimes, I
        randomly think about that time not too long ago when we died laughing in
        bed because you said ”Imagine Elias told me he’s pregnant” and how we
        laughed for 10 minutes straight and after that you said, ”I love your
        cute laugh” and my heart jumped. Or our bi-weekly competition of ”Can I
        tell you a secret?” I think about ”Matcha and Missionary”.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then sometimes I think about a quote of yours you said back in May:
        ”No one has ever learned their lesson by simply being forgiven for their
        wrongdoings.” What a loaded thing to say, but a very truthful thing as
        well. You’re right. And I’m holding on to that. Maybe we would’ve never
        learned our lesson in what we need to do and change in our relationship,
        or been urged to solve problems in our surroundings, if we had simply
        forgiven ourselves and each other for our wrongdoings within the
        relationship and not been apart. Maybe this is us trying to force
        ourselves back into the reality that is the consequences of our actions
        and the limitations put upon us.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s day 2 of no-contact and we’ll see how long this goes. Technically,
        I have another 20 days of that ahead of me, but I’m not sure whether
        that’s what you want or whether you want me to reach out to you as a
        friend or just to stay in contact generally. We’ll see. I don’t know
        when we’ll get to a point where you’ll think I’m clear enough in my head
        for a conversation about our relationship. What I do know though is that
        when we do get there and we do talk, it will be in person. That is
        something I’ve already reflected on. A lot of things would be different,
        if we had done them in person – including our breakup. But it’s too late
        now to reminisce over "What could’ve been if...", so I’ll be focusing on
        "What has to happen in order for...W". So yeah, once again, I love you
        and till we hug again, Dudu.
