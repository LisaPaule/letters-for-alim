        These letters are for any possible scenario in our relationship like
        when I'm not there to tell you, or when you need to feel loved and don't
        want to ask for it. But also when we're in places we can't imagine right
        now. This is for when you need to understand what's running through my
        mind, but can't or don't want to ask. This is for when you need to be
        reminded of your girlfriend and how she thought (since she doesn't exist
        in that way anymore.)

      <p>
        ...when I'm not there to tell you, and you have feelings you need
        validation for or thoughts you need to feel heard, I want you to open
        these letters and be reminded that there is a person out there who loves
        you, always, forever and deeply.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn't write a letter for this because it's two simple sentences: If
        by any chance you don't believe in yourself anymore, borrow my belief in
        you, until you can believe in yourself again. And if by any chance you
        don't trust in yourself and the choices you make, borrow my belief in
        that you will always do what's best for yourself and your surrounding.
      </p>
      <p>
        And if by any chance, there comes a day in which you don't believe these
        words no more, in which we've drifted apart, remember: I wrote these
        letters out of love for you, not out of trust, not out of passion, not
        out of respect. These are a compilation of true love for the person you
        are. And I will never stop loving you. I haven't now either. You will
        always have a chunk of my heart, even when I loose my spot in yours. And
        as long as you live, as long as you stay true to yourself and your
        beliefs, these letters will have meaning the same way they did when I
        wrote them.
      </p>
      <p>
        To love you has been and always will be the pleasure and peace in my
        life. You are mine and I am yours.

      <p>
        Every month of every year and every year for the rest of our lives, I
        hope I get to write such letters to you. Letters that compile not only
        my love, but also my vision, my view, my feelings and my hope for us.
        These letters are supposed to be a constant reminder that we have gone
        through so much and we survived, as individuals and as a couple. They
        are supposed to show you, that we can. We can be that exeption. We can
        love and we can make it work. They're supposed to be reflections, and if
        they work, we will sit in a couple years and read these and laugh at all
        the moments captured, reminisce about all the times shared. They are
        reminders of who me and you are.

        This is the hardest section of them all. It's the section that discusses
        the unsaid issues that came within the relationship and led to the end
        of it. It's the part that shows the aspects we didn't handle well, and
        is my way of holding space for you. It's my hope for a future and my
        capturing of a time in which we were apart, with the hope for reflecting
        and showing my personal progress through our time apart. This is the
        section that holds the most potential and the one hardest do describe as
        anything other than painful. It's my call to you that says "Stay with
        me.", but also my admission in that I trust you. I trust you in that you
        always do what's best for yourself and us. And if you think this is the
        only way we have a chance, then I will trust. This is the proof for my
        unyielding love and trust for and in you.
