        These letters are for any possible scenario in our relationship like
        when I'm not there to tell you, or when you need to feel loved and don't
        want to ask for it. But also when we're in places we can't imagine right
        now. This is for when you need to understand what's running through my
        mind, but can't or don't want to ask. This is for when you need to be
        reminded of your girlfriend.

      <p>
        ...when I'm not there to tell you, and you have feelings you need
        validation for or thoughts you need to feel heard, I want you to open
        these letters and be reminded that there is a person out there who loves
        you, always, forever and deeply.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn't write a letter for this because it's two simple sentences: If
        by any chance you don't believe in yourself anymore, borrow my belief in
        you, until you can believe in yourself again. And if by any chance you
        don't trust in yourself and the choices you make, borrow my belief in
        that you will always do what's best for yourself and your surrounding.
      </p>
      <p>
        And if by any chance, there comes a day in which you don't believe these
        words no more, in which we've drifted apart, remember: I wrote these
        letters out of love for you, not out of trust, not out of passion, not
        out of respect. These are a compilation of true love for the person you
        are. And I will never stop loving you. I haven't now either. You will
        always have a chunk of my heart, even when I loose my spot in yours. And
        as long as you live, as long as you stay true to yourself and your
        beliefs, these letters will have meaning the same way they did when I
        wrote them.
      </p>
      <p>
        To love you has been and always will be the pleasure and peace in my
        life. You are mine and I am yours.

      <p>
        Every month of every year and every year for the rest of our lives, I
        hope I get to write such letters to you. Letters that compile not only
        my love, but also my vision, my view, my feelings and my hope for us.
        These letters are supposed to be a constant reminder that we have gone
        through so much and we survived, as individuals and as a couple. They
        are supposed to show you, that we can. We can be that exeption. We can
        love and we can make it work. They're supposed to be reflections, and if
        they work, we will sit in a couple years and read these and laugh at all
        the moments captured, reminisce about all the times shared. They are
        reminders of who me and you are.

      <p>
        This is the hardest section of them all. It's the section that discusses
        the unsaid issues that came within the relationship and led to the end
        of it. It's the part that shows the aspects we didn't handle well, and
        is my way of holding space for you. It's my hope for a future and my
        capturing of a time in which we are apart, with the hope for reflecting
        and showing my personal progress. This is the section that holds the
        most potential and the one hard to describe as anything other than
        painful. It's my call to you that says, "Stay with me," but also my
        admission that I trust you. I trust you in that you always do what's
        best for yourself and us. And if you think this is the only way we have
        a chance, then I will trust that. This is the proof for my unyielding
        love for and trust in you.

      <h2 class="section-title">OH FUCK NO.</h2>
      <p>
        Wish it would've been different, but it wasn't. Feel glad because it
        means I'm free. Hope you realise this broke any chance we had–not me,
        not your person, but your behaviour and mine too. I am done and I know
        you are too. I came because I wanted to make sure you were fine and you
        weren't hurting. You responded to that with the threat of wanting to
        hurt me. You thought I'd do something to you like you didn't sleep next
        to me for 7 months, with no fear that I'd hurt you there right? I don't
        know what's going through your mind and I'm glad it's not my problem
        anymore. I hope when you look back and you understand, maybe even read
        my journal, you see that all I ever wanted was to be happy and I thought
        you could be that with me. Now I realise you can't and you don't want to
        be. I'm sorry I made you feel like I was going to harm you. Maybe I
        acted a lil too obsessed or crazy, but at the end at least I was willing
        to lose myself to show someone else they deserved to be loved. I
        would've done anything to make you see yourself through my eyes and I
        hope she does the same. And if she doesn't, I hope the next relationship
        you enter, the person knows not to give their all to you because you
        will take it and leave. And I hope the next girl who falls in love with
        you will see what I didn't and will know when to go and when to stay.
        Bye.

      <h2 class="section-title">I forgive you</h2>
      <p>
        I forgive you. I had a conversation with Adelina and I thought a lot,
        and this is dramatic and stupid. But I forgive you. I'm a bit butthurt
        you removed me from your Youtube Premium, and it's hard to realise it
        was so easy for you to cut me from your life when you were so unwilling
        to cut her from it when I'd asked you to, but I am getting over you.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
      <h2 class="section-title">Moving on</h2>
      <p>
        It's funny how I was so convinced it would be incredibly hard to move on
        from you, but it took me one fun time out drinking and a healthy routine
        to feel happy again. One thing I feel I need to mention is that
        throughout all of this–the talks with Adelina, the tears shed over you
        and the fights with my family over whether there was a bet, whether I'm
        a slut or not, and whatever other conversation I was forced to indulge
        in because of you–I never lied. I never defamed our relationship and I'm
        more aware of the ups and the downs we had. I didn't read through our
        chats because I know it wouldn't have been healthy. I left our shared
        folder because I knew one day you'd do it first and I didn't want to
        wait for that day. I'm stopping to chase you.
      </p>
      <p>
        But you know what's funny? Throughout it, I continue thinking: He never
        said he doesn't love me anymore. You never said you fell out of love or
        that there was no future. You seemed hurt when I said there was no
        chance in the future. And I mean that. I've thought long and hard and
        I've come to the realisation we're entirely different in our
        communication. So unless you are willing and able to give me a full
        rundown of the events that led to this, I don't see how the trust could
        ever be restored. And maybe that's the point. Maybe it shouldn't. Maybe
        we both deserve different–not better, because we were quite perfect.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm starting to willingly forget you and I welcome the peace that comes
        with that. I'm starting to forgive myself for letting you walk away, and
        I welcome that because when I rationalise it, I realise time and time
        again that I held onto you so hard that my fingers bled.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll always miss you. But I also feel like I'll always feel betrayed. I
        doubt you ever think about the damage that you did, but I hold on to
        every detail like my life depends on it. I hear your voice every time
        that I think I'm not enough. How could anybody do the things you did so
        easily? It takes strength to forgive, but I don't feel strong. I
        sometimes fantasise about a time you're a little fucking sorry. And I
        try to understand why you would do this to me. You must be insecure, you
        must be so unhappy. And I know in my heart that hurt people hurt people.
        And we both drew blood, but man, those cuts were never equal.
      </p>

    <section class="container">
      <h2 class="section-title">September 13th</h2>
      <p>
        It's funny I still write to you here hahaha. I know I won't reach out to
        you again, but I also want you to be able to be part of my life if you
        want to be (somehow idk). I wish we had been able to be friends, but my
        love for you and your plan to hurt me made it impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope one day we get the chance to sit down and we can talk. I hope one
        day you miss me enough to wish to try again, and I hope when that day
        comes, I love you again. I'm falling out of it. I'm talking with other
        people now. They're fun. They pick me up. They care and they show it to
        me in ways different to you. I look for you in them, but I don't find
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wish Mila had never entered your life or our relationship because then
        we'd still have a chance. But now, even if she might have been nothing,
        even if she was just a rebound or you never fell for her, you still
        chose her. You choose to love her and you left me when I needed you
        most.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wonder whether we're in No Contact or whether we're just done. I
        wonder whether you've ever went on this website again. I wonder whether
        you ever will. I wonder what'll happen if you do. I wonder whether
        you've noticed I left our shared folder. I wonder whether you have me
        blocked on WhatsApp. I know you didn't block my number, but don't worry.
        I won't reach out.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know how long I have left with these feelings inside of me. It's
        not because of you. It's barely because of me even. But there's just
        this emptiness I wake up and fall asleep with, and even when I try and
        sometimes manage to fill it during the day, it just never goes away.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't see a future anymore. I don't know why I'm writing this here, as
        physical proof, why I give you this power over me. It's not to guilt
        trip you. It's not to bring you back. You're just the only person I ever
        truly wanted. The only person I wanted to have in my life. Maybe that
        hurts too. Because if it had been up to me, I would've lived under a
        bridge with you–no money, no perspective, nothing. Just us. But I
        would've gotten a good nights rest beside you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I don't sleep through the night. I've lost 4kg since we broke up and
        I'm sure my body intends to drop even more. I have no appetite, no
        reason to wake up and feel good anymore. I started smoking, whether it's
        to piss you off from a distance or to be closer to you, I don't know. I
        force myself to smile, and it's funny because what I'm describing is the
        reason you fell out of love. I'm proving you right: I loved you too
        much.
      </p>
      <p>
        So here I sit, and I know that if I live, I'll spend the rest of my life
        on the sidelines watching another person make you happy, watching you
        forget who I am and what we were. The thought of that physically hurts
        me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wish I had come back with you that Sunday. I wonder how the story
        would've gone had I not let you go that Tuesday. I ask myself every
        single day where we would be if I had held your hand that Wednesday. I
        miss you. With every fibre of my being.
      </p>
      <p>
        So if you wake up a month from now and decide to give this another try,
        I'll be here. If you think about me in five years and wish to maybe give
        it another try, I'll be here. And if you do ever reach back out to me,
        please remind me to never let you go again.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
      <h2 class="section-title">September 19th</h2>
      <p>
        Missing you isn't just about missing the relationship. It's having a
        dream with you, and feeling comfort again for the first time in a month,
        and it's waking up with a pit in my stomach and tears in my eyes. It's
        having Duku still on my bed and the white pillow you cried into, but not
        being able to touch them because it hurts. It's opening your contact
        when I achieved something and realising you don't care anymore. It's
        writing these letters for you that you might never read just to keep you
        close.
      </p>
      <p>
        My biggest fear is that I die with this pain in my chest. That one day I
        wake up and say "Fuck it" and when I reach out to you because I need you
        to know I still love you, you're just gone. That one day you wake up and
        say "Today's the day" and you reach out to me, and I'm already gone.
      </p>
      <p>
        I fear that when I lay there and I wait for the darkness to finally
        swallow me whole, you don't feel a thing. That you have let go off me,
        and that you don't even remember how it was when you held me close.
      </p>
      <p>
        I fear that I'll miss you forever. That in 30 years when all is done and
        we're so far apart there's no possibility of an us, I'll still miss you.
        And that you won't even remember my name.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope you love her and I hope she loves you too. I hope you think of me
        when you're alone and I hope you look for me in her. I hope you find me
        sometimes somewhere in her jokes, her laugh, her opinions and who she
        wants to be to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've wanted to call you so often it's ridiculous. But I know you don't
        want to hear from me. I am trying to respect your wishes for once, and
        it hurts. Our eight month anniversary would've been on Tuesday. I'll
        blow the candles out for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I won't forget how you cried into that pillow, Alim. I won't forget how
        you held me when I cried. We did love each other. And I still love you,
        so if I ever got a chance to speak to you again, I'd ask you whether we
        can try again. And I'd promise this time, to do it right. And if I get
        to have another chance, I'd cherish you. I promise. I'd see you for who
        you are and I'd love every piece of you.
      </p>
      <p>
        So please, if we ever get to have another chance, let me tell you
        something. No matter how close you are, if you were closer, I'd kiss
        you.
      </p>

    <section class="container">
      <h2 class="section-title">September 20th</h2>
      <p>
        This reminds me of the time we fought and didn't speak for a whole day.
        I hope you don't think of this as that because my heart is breaking a
        bit more every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe I should convince myself that this is just a small fight and that
        rn we're in No Contact and we'll be fine. I think before coming to your
        place that was more or less true. But then somehow you thought the
        person you'd always spoken of as caring and attentive wouldn't notice
        that something is off and try and help.
      </p>
      <p>I was right btw.</p>
      <p>Which is not me being arrogant, but just aware.</p>

      <p>
        I don't understand you. I don't understand what your intentions are and
        what you meant to achieve with those messages. U make me mad and you
        make me sad. But above everything, you worry me.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
      <h2 class="section-title">September 24th</h2>
      <p>
        Alim, I know my opinion doesn't matter to you. And I know you don't want
        my help, but please. Please don't throw your life away.
      </p>
      <p>
        I understand being in a bad place. I understand needing space. But I'm
        starting to think we broke up because you didn't want someone there to
        help and try to fix things for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have no playroom here. I don't know you anymore and none of this is
        any of my business, but I'm just here to say that I always believed in
        you and knew you could be great, if you just put the effort in. If you
        need help, there's no shame in asking for it. I don't need to be your
        girlfriend in order to try and help you. If you asked Nelli not to tell
        me, she wouldn't. I'm not saying we're better than everyone and you have
        to come talk with us, but I'm sorry to say it like this and I don't mean
        to undermine you or your circle, but your friends (at least what I've
        seen) don't seem to care.
      </p>
      <p>
        They either don't realise how bad some of this might actually be or
        don't care for you. It's rough of me to say it like that but I don't
        know how else to put it.
      </p>
      <p>
        You were one of my best friends and a person I deeply cared for and
        trusted. I believe I was the same to you. But this isn't about being
        girlfriend and boyfriend.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know what's wrong, but something is. And you need to find help.
      </p>
      <p>
        If, in those messages you sent, you had any intention of speaking to me
        again or getting on good terms, if you care one bit about any of this,
        please find help.
