      <h1>Day 5 Post-Break Up</h1>
      <p>
        Wish it would've been different, but it wasn't. Feel glad because it
        means I'm free. Hope you realise this broke any chance we had–not me,
        not your person, but your behaviour and mine too.
      </p>
      <p>I am done and I know you are too.</p>
      <p>
        I came because I wanted to make sure you were fine and you weren't
        hurting. You responded to that with the threat of wanting to hurt me.
        You thought I'd do something to you like you didn't sleep next to me for
        7 months, with no fear that I'd hurt you there, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know what's going through your mind and I'm glad it's not my
        problem anymore. I hope when you look back and you understand, maybe
        even read my journal, you see that all I ever wanted was to be happy and
        I thought you could be that with me. Now I realise you can't and you
        don't want to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm sorry I made you feel like I was going to harm you. Maybe I acted a
        lil too obsessed or crazy, but at the end at least I was willing to lose
        myself to show someone else they deserved to be loved. I would've done
        anything to make you see yourself through my eyes and I hope she does
        the same. And if she doesn't, I hope the next relationship you enter,
        the person knows not to give their all because it can be taken and
        destroyed. And I hope the next girl who falls in love with you will see
        what I didn't and will know when to go and when to stay. Bye.
