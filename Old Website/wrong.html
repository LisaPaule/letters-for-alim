      <h1>Happy Valentine's Day</h1>
      <p>
        Dear Alim, Happy Valentine's Day! While I know I tell you every day and
        I will continue to do so, I have to tell you one more time: I love you,
        Alim. And not only that, I am in love with you. And with every little
        part of you. I'm in love with everything about you, from your hair, over
        the beauty mark on your neck all the way to your little toe. And I
        believe you know that, and hope you never doubt that.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this is basically the final version of this project, I thought of
        a way to make sure it runs on forever. I will edit it, tweak it, fix
        mistakes and add letters every once in a while. And every time I do,
        I'll send you the html code again. So that it's like an update, and we
        can both watch the progression of our relationship with the years. And I
        believe there's years.
      </p>
      <p>
        While talking about my university applications recently, you said that
        you felt in a way anxious to tell me your thoughts because you didn't
        know how long I am thinking this relationship will be. And you didn't
        want to influence my entire future, or suggest an influential option, if
        I was considering us for being together only for a couple of months. And
        I must say: That statement made me slightly angry. Because do I not make
        you feel like I want this forever? Do you not see the stars in my eyes
        when I look at you? Do you not feel the goosebumps, my fast beating
        heart, the shuddery breaths, the spiral in my brain when I lose my train
        of thought simply because I've looked into your eyes? Do you not see and
        feel how much I love you? Because sometimes, I feel like it is actually
        tangible, grabbable. I am in this forever, if you are too. And I don't
        need you to make promises we can't keep. I don't need you to tell me you
        love me and you want to be together forever. I know that. What I need
        you to tell me is if you believe in us. Do you believe that we can and
        will be together forever? Regardless of what the future holds. Do you
        believe if we continued to feel the way we do now, the way we behave now
        and be the way we are right in this very moment, we'd last a life time?
        Because I do. And that is the reason I'm writing this first letter. That
        is the reason I decided to jump into the cold water for you. That is the
        reason I smile every time you smile, and I cry every time you cry. And
        if I get to choose, I'd be holding you in my arms every night before we
        fall asleep. I'd be feeling your breath in the crook of my neck and I'd
        be feeling the soft skin under your shirt when I go over it. I'd feel
        your heart beat against my cheek every single day and night for the rest
        of our lives. And Alim, one more time: You are loved by me, deeply and
        sincerely. Adored and devotedly. I love you, Alim Arslan Kaya.

      <h1>One Month Anniversary</h1>
      <p>
        Dear Alim,
        <br /><br />
        I can't believe it's already been one month since this beautiful journey
        began. A single month may seem short, but it feels like we've lived a
        lifetime of moments—tiny bits of laughter, whispers, and shared tears.
        You've shown me how love can sneak up on you and hold you soooo tightly,
        there's no letting go.
        <br /><br />
        I want you to know that every second with you has been a gift. Your
        smile brightens my day, your voice calms my anxieties, and your heart
        has become the center of my world. I cherish every moment I'm allowed to
        spend beside you, those we spend lying in bed, those we spend sitting in
        the same room doing different things, those we spend sleeping, but my
        most favourite ones are the mornings we share. The feeling of waking up
        next to you, holding your hand while you sleep, having you pull me close
        so that I don't immediately stand up, having your sleepy eyes find mine
        and your soft lifts peck mine. It's the most beautiful thing in the
        world, and the thing I miss the most when we don't sleep together. There
        is not a day that goes by where I'm not thankful for the choice we made
        to be together. There's not an hour that passes by where I don't wonder
        how I deserved you. There's not a minute that passes by where I don't
        wish to be even closer to you, regardless of whether I'm already
        basically inside of you. There's not a second that passes by in which I
        don't want to feel your incredibly strong heart beat right under the
        palm of my hands or right under my ear. And last, but not least, there's
        not a moment that passes by where I'm not incredibly aware of how lucky
        I am to call myself your girlfriend.
        <br /><br />
        And everytime you fall asleep beside me, I am incredibly happy and
        grateful. Happy that I give you peace enough for you to rest beside me.
        Grateful that I was brought into your life to allow you to rest. And
        everytime I look you in the eye while I feel soo self-conscious about
        myself, I am incredibly happy and grateful. Happy that you gave me peace
        enough for me to expose myself so happily to you. Grateful that you were
        brought into my life to allow me to feel at peace with myself enough to
        show myself to you.
        <br /><br />
        As you know, we've been together for only a month. But I'm very grateful
        for that, we've managed to identify and (somewhat at least) fix mistakes
        we saw. And I'm so happy I was there to provide you with enough love
        that you understood that everything is fine regardless and that your
        brain can rest from that at least for a bit. I know this bothered you a
        lot, even when I told you repeatedly that all is good. And I understand.
        But I'm very happy that I was, once again, proven right. Because guess
        what? It is all good. But I'll stop bragging about my all-knowing brain,
        and go back to the reason for me writing this letter.
        <br /><br />
        Happy one month anniversary, my love. It has been a great journey, and a
        great month. Let's hope we have at least another 1199 months left
        surrounded by this happiness. I love you so incredibly much.
        <br /><br />
        In love,
        <br />
        Your Lisa

      <h1>Two Month Anniversary</h1>
      <p>
        Dear dudu,
        <br /><br />
        It's been two months! Yay! We're already 1/546 through the timeline of
        this beautiful thing we're building–and somehow it already feels like
        forever in the best way possible. I don’t think either of us could be
        any happier (well, maybe slightly happier if we didn't include blowjobs,
        the number of times I’ve cooked, and how many cuddles I’ve received
        (insert sad emoji)). But hey, who’s keeping score? Every day I wake up,
        I want you. All of you. I want your hands in mine, your lips against
        mine, and that look in your eyes that makes me melt every single time. I
        want us tangled together, forgetting time, wrapped in soft sheets and
        each other’s heat. You know exactly how to make me feel like the only
        person in the world. But beyond all the hot, sex-related thoughts I am
        having right now—and god, there’s a lot of them—I keep dreaming of
        everything we’ll build.
        <br /><br />
        I dream of a pretty apartment that smells like coffee, brownies and you.
        Minimalist, a little chaotic in the corners because we’re living in it,
        really living. We’ll fight over which way the knives should go in the
        drawer or who should do the dishes, then make up in bed an hour later.
        Three little humans. Jen—our fierce, funny girl (who’ll insist we stop
        calling her Jennifer by the time she’s 7). She's just like her mother.
        Ilya—soft-hearted but sharp-eyed and cut-throat like his father. And our
        littlest boy, name still TBD, but I already love the way I imagine him
        crawling into our bed in the morning, tangling himself between us,
        ruining MY cuddle time but being soo cute, I can't even be mad. I dream
        of waking up with you every day, making breakfast for us five, getting
        ready for the day, loving the life we've built. I dream of soccer
        practices, parent-teacher conferences, movie nights, game nights, all
        kinds of nights, road trips (you drive), eating out, eating in, cooking,
        dancing in the kitchen to Prince Royce, watching our favourite shows
        together. I dream of soo many beautiful moments that I want to share
        with you.
        <br /><br />
        A wedding. God, a beautiful wedding. Your eyes when you see me. The kiss
        that changes everything and nothing all at once. A beautiful bride and
        the most handsome groom the world has ever seen. Dancing all night,
        drunk on champagne and each other. A home that grows with us. A friend
        group from uni—our people, our chaos, our laughs. Moving from our
        beautiful apartment into our beautiful house, both being our homes
        because I share them with you. Always you.
        <br /><br />
        Loving each other forever sounds like a fairytale, but with you, it
        feels like the only possible truth. I want to be the 2% that make it.
        And I think we can be, if we go the way we have. If we love, respect,
        want the best for and believe in each other.
        <br /><br />
        And I don't mean it in that delusional, teenage-love kind of way. I mean
        it in the
        I-know-there'll-be-tough-times,-but-I-think-we-can-withstand-them kind
        of way. I mean it in the
        there'll-be-times-I-want-to-kill-you,-but-I-can't-because-I-love-you
        kind of way. I mean it in the
        there'll-come-a-day-you'll-be-mad-with-me,-but-forgive-me-because-you-love-me
        kind of way. I mean it in the
        I-love-you-soo-much-I-can't-imagine-not-loving-you-anymore kind of way.
        I think I've brought my point across.
        <br /><br />
        So let me get back to the main point (a repeating pattern hahaha).
        <br /><br />
        Happy two months, baby. Here’s to the other 545.
        <br /><br />
        In love,
        <br />
        Your bubu

      <h1>Three Month Anniversary</h1>
      <p>
        My love,
        <br /><br />
        Three months. Three whole months of being yours and you being mine.
        Three months of growing, of learning, of laughing... and yes, even of a
        few misunderstandings and arguments. I know things have felt a little
        off lately—like maybe we’ve been just slightly out of sync, missing each
        other in the little moments, feeling less connected than usual maybe
        too. But I also know this: love isn't always just butterflies and
        daydreams. Sometimes, it's messy. Sometimes, it stumbles. And I think
        that's part of the journey.
        <br /><br />
        While recently, I think there's been a couple of moments in which I felt
        like we were crumbling a bit maybe, not because anything changed in the
        way I perceive our relationship or my love for you, but just because I
        felt less emotional supoort than usual (which is usually a good thing,
        just the past two weeks hard to deal with), I still think we're going
        strong. After having thought a lot about the talks we had especially at
        the beginning of our relationship, I have come to the conclusion that
        some of the things I thought were realistic in a healthy relationship,
        probably aren't. An example for this is something we've had a couple of
        disagreements over lately. I think it's important to assume, especially
        when it comes to emotion. Oftentimes, it's very hard for the other
        person to speak up for themselves or make the first move first. Because,
        at least in my case, there's soo much overthinking involved, and just
        this constant fear that expressing my emotions and thoughts won't help.
        And maybe even that you'll realise how strenuous and unrewarding it is
        to be in a relationship with me, causing you to just leave. I've thought
        about this a lot recently, not because I in any way want to, or because
        you really gave any indication that you want to, but I don't think you
        quite understand what it's like in the mind of an overthinker. My
        constant, every thought is about how I can make you the least annoyed
        with me as possible, how I can keep you, how I can please you and how I
        can make this last as long as possible. It's like I'm so scared you'll
        leave me that I can't enjoy the time you're still here. And when you're
        gone, I will wish I had enjoyed it more, and that's what really scares
        me.
        <br /><br />
        I'm not usually a very emotional person. You can ask anybody who knows
        me well, and they will tell you two things about me: I don't cry, and I,
        per usual, don't care. Not enough to fight for it. But I've cried.
        Thrice this week. And I didn't like it. And I didn't want to. But what
        felt worse is that I didn't want you to know that I had, or that I was.
        Let me tell you what's constantly running through my mind.
        <br /><br />
        The first time I cried was on Wednesday I think. After you asked me why
        I was sad and I couldn't give you an answer. You got frustrated,
        understandably, and I cried not because I was that sad, but because I
        wasn't a good enough girlfriend to keep you out of my head. My thoughts
        were spinning, and it wasn't stopping or slowing down. And so I
        overheated. I was so worried. Worried you'd be so annoyed with me.
        Worried you'd realise you deserve better. Worried you'd simply be fed
        up. And so I couldn't keep it bottled up anymore, and I cried. In the
        bathroom. Silently. And then afterwards I washed my face with cold
        water, rinsed my eyes out to and five minutes later, when we spoke, you
        didn't notice. And while that made me glad because I didn't want you to
        feel bad or worry about me, or leave your PC to console me, I also
        wondered what I'm doing. I wondered whether this is a form of
        self-sabotage I'm committing and I got so incredibly sad at the thought
        of losing you because of my twisted, fucked-up brain making up something
        in my head to ruin the beautiful reality I share with you. And then came
        Thursday, and I cried again. I don't even know why. I just did. But I
        smiled through it, because I didn't want you to notive that I was sad
        again. And I didn't want you to know. Because in a way it's embarassing.
        And useless, and it's not me. But maybe it's becoming me. And I don't
        know what to do about it. And then came Friday morning. I woke up and
        decided to be happy. I decided today I wouldn't be sad, I'd be happy,
        and I'd make you believe that it's all fine again. And it was the
        morning right after you woke up, and you asked me not to cuddle so much
        because it is a waste of time. Or rather, the amount we do it wastes
        hours of the day. And you're not wrong, and I want you to always be
        honest with me about what you're feeling, but I don't know. It hit me.
        And it made me sad, because it was in a way exactly what I'd feared. It
        was that feeling of distance. The breaking of patterns leads to the
        allowance of change. And change leads to disinvolvement. And
        disinvolvement leads to breaking up. So because I had decided to not
        show my sadness, I went on a walk. I know you know I was sad. But at
        least this way, you didn't see the extent of it. I walked through Grone,
        I bought a drink and I sat down at a bench and cried. Because I was so
        tired. Not of you or because of anything you'd done. But because of me,
        and how broken I am. But then I stood back up, put my shoulders back and
        decided that this is not who I am. Sometimes, people go through rough
        patches, and I believe this time, I'm allowed to be sad. I'm allowed and
        supposed to acknowledge that it is hard right now, even when that is
        partially my fault. And I am going to be okay.
        <br /><br />
        I also want you to know that nothing about the way I see you has
        changed. Nothing about the way I feel for you has faded. You are still
        the same person who makes my heart beat a little too fast when you walk
        into a room. You’re still the same soul I want to wake up next to every
        morning—whether we fell asleep laughing or after a fight or argument.
        <br /><br />
        What we’re going through? I think it’s part of it. Part of learning how
        to love each other better. How to communicate without fear, how to hold
        space without needing to fix everything, how to choose each other even
        when it’s hard. And the beautiful thing is—we’re doing it. Even when it
        might be hard at times, we’re still here. Still trying. Still choosing
        each other. And that matters more to me than one tear shed or not.
        <br /><br />
        I’m not scared of rough patches, because I believe in us. I believe in
        what we have. I believe we’re strong enough, honest enough, and we love
        enough about each other to be okay. I trust the way you love me, and I
        hope you trust the way I love you, too. Fully, and at all times.
        <br /><br />
        So here’s to three months of loving each other—on the easy days, and on
        the ones where we don’t get it quite right. Here’s to all the times
        we’ve laughed until our stomachs hurt, and all the times we’ve held onto
        each other a little tighter after hard conversations. Here's to what
        we’ve already built, and everything still to come.
        <br /><br />
        I still want the whole future with you, Alim. I still see that apartment
        that smells like brownies and you. I still see Jen and Ilya and the baby
        with no name stealing my cuddles. I still see you and me—maybe a little
        older, maybe a little greyer (even tho you're already grey at 18..
        damn), but still tangled up in each other, still arguing about dishes
        and still sooo in love.
        <br /><br />
        Happy three months, my dudu. You are my home.
        <br /><br />
        In love (still, always),
        <br />
        Your Lisa
        <br /><br />
        <strong>PS:</strong> I will never count. Not the cuddles, not the
        arguments, not the days we’re off, not the days we’re perfect. Just the
        fact that it’s you. Always you.

      <h2>Four Month Anniversay</h2>
      <p>Dear Allyedge</p>
      <p>
        Four months ago, we began a journey that has been filled with love,
        growth, and unforgettable moments. Through all the highs and lows, we've
        only grown, and today, I want to celebrate the incredible connection we
        share. "You will always be in my heart with unconditional love." (2Pac,
        "Unconditional Love")<br /><br />
        Your care for me has been one of the cornerstones of our relationship,
        the same way my love and care for you has. And especially by being apart
        from you, I've learned that "I don't wanna give you the wrong
        impression, I need your love and affection." (Rihanna ft. Future,
        "Loveeeeeee Song") Your presence brings comfort and warmth to my life.
        The way you hold me, listen to me, and stand by me speaks volumes more
        than words ever could. "I hope you never leave, I give you my heart, I
        mean it." (Lil Baby ft. Fridayy, "Forever") Every day with you feels
        like a second chance to do the things wrong I did yesterday, to retry to
        make you see how much I truly love you. You have taught me so many
        things, such as for example how to do exactly what I'm doing right now.
        But also, you've taught me to stand up to myself, to trust you, to
        accept myself as equal to others. And you have taugh me the true meaning
        of partnership and commitment. "She wanna know who I am, she don't give
        a f* who I was." (Lil Tecca & Ken Carson, "Fell In Love") You've
        accepted me for who I am, embracing both my strengths and my flaws. Your
        acceptance has allowed me to grow and become a better person.<br /><br />
        "I did things for you, even when you ain't ask me to." (Lil Baby,
        "Everything") Through you I've learned that it is equal in a
        relationship. You give and you get. And also I learned that I sometimes
        didn't pay attention to when you'd give, but more when you took. But
        ever since, I've been trying to be more attentive and see you–for who
        you are. And I've learned that the little things you do make a big
        difference in my life.<br /><br />
        One more thing I've learned about myself in the past months of our
        relationship is that "I wanna be confident when I say you my lady, I
        wanna be arrogant when I say you mine, baby." (Future, "LOVE YOU
        BETTER") Being with you fills me with pride. And I want the same for
        you. Your love empowers me and gives me the confidence to face anything
        that comes our way. "We must remember that tomorrow comes after the
        dark." (2Pac, "Unconditional Love") So, through every storm, we've found
        our rainbow. Your touch, your words, your presence—every aspect of you
        brings me peace and joy. "I hope you never leave, I give you my heart, I
        mean it." (Lil Baby ft. Fridayy, "Forever") As we celebrate this
        milestone, I look forward to many more years of laughter, love, and
        shared dreams. Thank you for being my partner, my confidant, and my
        greatest love.<br /><br />
        Happy Anniversary, my love. <br /><br />
        Forever yours.

      <h2>Five month anniversary</h2>
      <p>
        Mi amor<br /><br />
        It feels like both the quickest and most meaningful stretch of time I’ve
        ever lived. Each day with you adds another layer to what we have—more
        trust, more understanding, more love. We’ve been learning each other in
        ways that make me realize just how rare it is to find something this
        real. “From the first day I met you, it was special.” (Future, I'M DAT
        N***A)
        <br /><br />
        Being with you has shown me that love isn’t just about the highs—it’s
        about standing together when things are uncertain, when life feels
        heavy, when we don’t have all the answers. “Even when I'm wrong, you're
        right there to hold me down.” (2Pac, Me and My Girlfriend) I’ve seen the
        strength in your heart and the way you give yourself to the people you
        love. You’ve made me feel safe enough to do the same.
        <br /><br />
        I’ve noticed the little ways you’ve shaped me without even trying—how I
        speak up more, how I trust deeper, how I let myself be fully seen. I
        just want you to know: “You are appreciated.” (2Pac, Keep Ya Head Up)
        You’ve shown me that my flaws aren’t things to hide, but parts of me you
        still choose, every single day.
        <br /><br />
        When we’re apart, I hold on to the thought of you like an anchor. Your
        voice, your laugh, the way you look at me—it all stays with me. “No
        matter the distance, I'm comin' to you.” (Future, Love You Better)
        You’re my person, in every season, in every distance. I want you to know
        that I’m proud to love you. Not quietly, not halfway, but all in. “I
        just wanna take you out and show you off.” (Future, Turn On The Lights)
        You make me want to be better—not because you demand it, but because
        being with you feels like something worth protecting and growing.
        <br /><br />
        So here’s to five months of us—and to the endless months ahead. You’ve
        given me more joy than I thought possible, more peace than I thought I
        deserved, and more love than I knew how to ask for. “My unconditional
        love for you will never die.” (2Pac, Unconditional Love)
        <br /><br />Happy Anniversary, my love. <br /><br />
        Here’s to everything we’ve built and everything still to come.<br /><br />
        In love,<br /><br />
        Il tuo amore

      <h2>Six month anniversary</h2>
      <p>
        Dear Romeo,<br /><br />
        Six months is a long time. I am unbelievably proud of us for how far
        we've come, and how well we've managed to maintain this love we have for
        one another.
        <br /><br />
        Us supporting and loving each other the way we have has been a pleasure
        for me, as I hope it has for you. You have shown me how to laugh with a
        person right after having cried. You have shown me how to feel desired
        and how to truly desire another person. You have shown me attraction,
        intimacy, truth, passion, understanding, hurt and endurance. But most
        importantly you have shown me how it feels to really love a person.
        <br /><br />
        I really love you, Alim. With all our ups and downs, all the flaws we
        will continue to find in each other, all the seemingly-heartbroken
        nights and the dreamlike mornings. And I will continue to love you for
        at least the next 200 6-months.
        <br /><br />
        I started this tradition about 5 months ago, with the intention of
        making you feel me close to you at any point in time you wish. And while
        it did take me 5 months to finish, I think I have with everything I
        wanted so far. Once I've worked on my overall computer and programming
        skills, I will update this and make it a notes app or something, in
        which you can always read and I can update more regularly.
        <br /><br />
        I really hope we get to that point in our relationship, but I believe
        that we can if we put ourselves aside and prioritise what is
        important–us. (And if I manage to get my shit together, stop
        procastinating and continue learning.) I know sometimes I can be hard on
        myself, on you, to handle, generally hard, but please don't give up on
        me.
        <br /><br />Happy Anniversary, my love. <br /><br />
        I try to be better, get better, and sometimes, it's hard. When that
        happens, I hope I don't make you feel it, but if I should, please
        forgive me. I know it's egoistic of me to ask that from you, and I'd
        never want you to forgive me for something unforgiveable or something
        bad enough (I think you know that), but I'm just asking you to hold on
        to us, if you can (and want). I want to build a future with you, and I
        hope you do too.<br /><br />
        I appreciate you. I love you.<br /><br />
        Your buburito
