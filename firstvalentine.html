      <h1>Happy Valentine's Day</h1>
      <p>
        Dear Alim, Happy Valentine's Day! While I know I tell you every day and
        I will continue to do so, I have to tell you one more time: I love you,
        Alim. And not only that, I am in love with you. And with every little
        part of you. I'm in love with everything about you, from your hair, over
        the beauty mark on your neck all the way to your little toe. And I
        believe you know that, and hope you never doubt that.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this is basically the final version of this project, I thought of
        a way to make sure it runs on forever. I will edit it, tweak it, fix
        mistakes and add letters every once in a while. And every time I do,
        I'll send you the html code again. So that it's like an update, and we
        can both watch the progression of our relationship with the years. And I
        believe there's years.
      </p>
      <p>
        While talking about my university applications recently, you said that
        you felt in a way anxious to tell me your thoughts because you didn't
        know how long I am thinking this relationship will be. And you didn't
        want to influence my entire future, or suggest an influential option, if
        I was considering us for being together only for a couple of months. And
        I must say: That statement made me slightly angry. Because do I not make
        you feel like I want this forever? Do you not see the stars in my eyes
        when I look at you? Do you not feel the goosebumps, my fast beating
        heart, the shuddery breaths, the spiral in my brain when I lose my train
        of thought simply because I've looked into your eyes? Do you not see and
        feel how much I love you? Because sometimes, I feel like it is actually
        tangible, grabbable. I am in this forever, if you are too. And I don't
        need you to make promises we can't keep. I don't need you to tell me you
        love me and you want to be together forever. I know that. What I need
        you to tell me is if you believe in us. Do you believe that we can and
        will be together forever? Regardless of what the future holds. Do you
        believe if we continued to feel the way we do now, the way we behave now
        and be the way we are right in this very moment, we'd last a life time?
        Because I do. And that is the reason I'm writing this first letter. That
        is the reason I decided to jump into the cold water for you. That is the
        reason I smile every time you smile, and I cry every time you cry. And
        if I get to choose, I'd be holding you in my arms every night before we
        fall asleep. I'd be feeling your breath in the crook of my neck and I'd
        be feeling the soft skin under your shirt when I go over it. I'd feel
        your heart beat against my cheek every single day and night for the rest
        of our lives. And Alim, one more time: You are loved by me, deeply and
        sincerely. Adored and devotedly. I love you, Alim Arslan Kaya.
