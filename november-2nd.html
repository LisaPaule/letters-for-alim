      <h1>Day 68 Post-Break Up</h1>
      <p>
        We spoke for quite a while last night, and I've come to a few
        conclusions, but none of them mean anything to you, so I won't bore you
        with the specifics.
      </p>
      <p>
        You asked me whether I think you are a robot with no emotions, and the
        issue is, Alim, that you don't understand how little I know what you're
        thinking and feeling. When I asked you last week, I didn't think you
        were thrilled or excited. When I cancelled yesterday, I didn't think you
        would even spend more than 10 minutes thinking about it. I know it's
        inconsiderate of me, but I've always said this and it's still true, you
        scare me. I cannot estimate you, cannot understand your thought process.
        And that fucking scares me.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you sat me down, looked me in the eyes and said, "No, I will not give
        up on you, or us. You're worth it. I'm gonna learn how to love you. I'm
        not going anywhere," I'd be right back there with you. All those things
        apply to me, but I don't know whether they apply to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through losing you, I've learned what it means to yearn for someone in a
        carnal and painful way. I've never experienced anything like this, and
        it's not because I lost this teenage love fantasy or because I'm not
        getting my sexual desires fulfilled. I love you, I care for you, I
        respect you and I appreciate you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know I've fucked up a couple of times, but I think we've both made
        mistakes that we can forgive each other for. I hope you can agree with
        me on that, and if you can't, that's fine too. I'll just go back to
        missing you from a distance and trying to move on from you, knowing damn
        well I won't.
      </p>
      <p>In love, Lisa.</p>
      <p>
        PS: I've come to the conclusions that I write these letters to reflect
        on them later, when either things become better, or they finally end. I
        don't want them to end, Alim. I want you back, but I don't want a fight,
        I want us to be happy, I want you to be happy and I want to be the
        reason you wake up smiling. Maybe one day, we'll get the chance again.
