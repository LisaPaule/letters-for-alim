      This is my plan for a 2-months that balances healing and getting clear in
      my head with keeping 'the door open' for a possibility of a future.
    </div>

    <details>
      <summary class="heading">Week 1-2</summary>
      <div class="nrone">
        <p class="textopen">
          No texts, calls, checking. Respect his wish for distance.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          Journal daily in No Contact. Write about what triggered fights, what I
          regret, what I'd want differently in the future.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          Take care of myself. Eat properly, sleep, exercise.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">Distract: Meet friends, work, write and sing.</p>
        <h3>Goal:</h3>
        <p class="textopen">
          Show him and myself that we can give each other space without breaking
          down fully.
        </p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary class="heading">Week 3-4</summary>
      <div class="nrtwo">
        <p class="textopen">
          Review journal: Look for patterns in why we clashed. (E.g. poor
          communication, unmet needs, unresolved insecurities, etc.)
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          Work on fixes. (E.g. reactive → practice patience, miscommunication ->
          conflict resolution strategies, etc.)
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">Still no direct contact til the end of the week.</p>
        <p class="textopen">
          Send a short neutral message. (E.g. "Hey, I just wanted to check in.
          No pressure. Hope you're doing fine.")
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          If he responds → engage calmly. If he doesn't → back off again.
        </p>
        <h3>Goal:</h3>
        <p class="textopen">
          Plant a seed that you respect boundaries but still care. Try and heal
          to open space for yourself and him to find a place in the
          relationship.
        </p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary class="heading">Week 5-6</summary>
      <div class="nrthree">
        <p class="textopen">
          If he replied → light conversation (No relationship talk)
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          If he didn't reply → wait til end of Week 6 to consider texting him
          (E.g. "I've been doing a lot of thinking these weeks. I'd really like
          us to talk when you feel ready - not to push, just to see where we
          stand.")
        </p>
        <h3>Goal:</h3>
        <p class="textopen">Open the door for dialogue without demanding it.</p>
      </div>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary class="heading">Week 7-8</summary>
      <div class="nrthree">
        <p class="textopen">
          If he's open to talking → suggest a call or meeting. Keep the
          conversation focused on the future, not rehashing fights.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          Present the idea of a trial reset: We don't jump back in. We see each
          other again, take it slow, and decide if it can work long-term.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          If he's still hesitant or ignores me → accept that he's not ready or
          not willing. At that point, reevaluate on whether to fully focus on
          healing moving forward without him or to continue trying and seeing
          where it goes. Do not pressure him.
        </p>
        <h3>Goal:</h3>
        <p class="textopen">
          Either restart with stronger foundations or get closure and stop
          waiting.
