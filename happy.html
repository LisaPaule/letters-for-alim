        <p class="textopen">Dear Dudu,</p>
        <p class="textopen">
          When something good happens to you and your first thought is to share
          it with me, I can’t tell you how much that means. It’s not just about
          the news itself—it’s about the fact that in that moment, you thought
          of me. Out of everyone you could tell, you chose me. That tells me I’m
          not just part of your life, I’m part of the way you process it.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          I love how your energy changes when you’re happy. Your voice gets
          lighter, your eyes get brighter, and you start talking faster because
          you just want to get it all out. I notice those things, every single
          time. And when I’m lucky enough to be there in person, I see the way
          you smile differently—full, unfiltered, and completely yours. That’s
          the kind of smile that makes me think, “I’d do anything to see this
          again.”
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          What I love even more is that your happiness never feels like it’s
          meant to be kept to yourself—you want it to spill over into the people
          you care about. And when you share it with me, it’s not just a story
          you’re telling, it’s an invitation to be part of that moment with you.
          That’s a gift. Because happiness is amplified when it’s shared, and
          when it’s with you, it becomes something we carry together.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          I want you to know that no matter what it is—whether it’s something
          huge that you’ve been working toward for months, or something small
          that just happened out of nowhere—I want to hear it. I want to be the
          first person you run to, the first name in your phone, the first face
          you look for in a crowd. I want to celebrate with you in ways that
          make the moment last longer, that make the memory sharper, that remind
          you that your wins are my wins too.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          So keep telling me when you’re happy. Keep letting me see that light
          in you. Because those moments aren’t just yours—they’re ours. And
          they’re the ones I’ll hold onto for a long time, long after the
          details fade.

        <p class="textopen">Dear Alim,</p>
        <p class="textopen">
          I love knowing you’re happy, even when I’m not there to see it. Of
          course, a part of me wishes I could be right beside you for every
          smile, every laugh, every good thing that happens—but knowing you’re
          out there feeling joy still makes me feel connected to you, no matter
          the distance.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          When we’re apart, I picture what it must look like—your expression,
          your body language, the way your eyes light up when you talk about
          something you love. I imagine the details I’m missing, and I store
          them away in my mind like I’ve actually been there. Because in some
          way, I am. I’m there in the way you think about telling me later, in
          the little mental note you make to share a story, in the fact that I’m
          part of your thoughts when good things happen.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          Your happiness isn’t something I have to physically witness to feel.
          It travels. It reaches me through your voice when you call, through
          the words you choose when you text, through the energy that somehow
          comes across even without touch or eye contact. And when you share
          those moments with me, it’s like I get a piece of the day you’ve
          lived, and it becomes part of my day too. I don’t need to be there for
          every good thing in your life to feel lucky that I’m part of it. But I
          want you to know that I’ll always be ready to hear about it, to replay
          it with you in detail, to celebrate it as if I’d been right next to
          you the whole time. Because your happiness—no matter where we are—is
          something I never get tired of holding onto.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          So when you’re smiling, don’t think it’s wasted on the distance. I
          feel it. I carry it. And when we’re together again, I want to hear
          every detail, so I can see the moment in your eyes as if I’d been
          there all along.
        </p>

        <p class="textopen">I love you and am happy with you,</p>

        <p class="textopen">Dear Dudu,</p>
        <p class="textopen">
          There’s something about knowing I’ve played a part in your happiness
          that’s impossible to put into simple words. It’s more than pride—it’s
          this deep, steady warmth that settles in me, knowing that I could give
          you a reason to smile, to laugh, to feel lighter. I never take that
          for granted.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          When I see that look in your eyes—the one you get when you’re happy in
          a way that’s just for us—it’s the best kind of confirmation that I’m
          doing something right. I notice it every time: the little curve of
          your mouth when you’re trying not to grin too hard, the way your
          shoulders drop like you’ve just let go of something heavy, the quiet
          ease that settles into your voice. Those moments make me want to keep
          showing up for you in ways that make you feel that way again and
          again.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          I don’t think it’s about grand gestures or perfect words. Sometimes
          it’s something small—a joke that lands just right, a meal you love, a
          moment where I really listened and understood. Sometimes it’s just me
          being there when you needed someone. But no matter how small, if it
          made your day better, then it’s worth it.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          I want to be someone who adds to your life, not just someone who’s
          there while you’re living it. I want to give you more days that you
          remember not just because they were good, but because they made you
          feel seen, appreciated, and loved. And when I realize I’ve been part
          of making that happen, it’s one of the most rewarding feelings in the
          world.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          So when you’re happy and I’m the reason, know that I don’t take it
          lightly. I carry that feeling with me, and it becomes my reason, too.
          Your joy fuels mine, and it makes me want to keep finding ways to make
          you feel this way—not because I have to, but because I can’t imagine
          wanting anything more than to see you like that.

        <p class="textopen">Alimlim,</p>
        <p class="textopen">
          Seeing you proud of yourself is one of my favorite things. There’s a
          difference in your happiness on those days—it’s deeper, stronger, more
          grounded. It’s not just about something good happening; it’s about you
          knowing you’ve earned it. You put in the work and you pushed through
          whatever might have made it easier to quit. That kind of pride is
          rare, and you should feel it fully.
        </p>

        <p class="textopen">
          I love the way you carry yourself when you’re proud. It’s not
          arrogance—it’s this quiet confidence that shows in your posture, in
          the way your voice steadies, in the way your eyes hold just a little
          more light. It’s like you’re standing taller without even realizing
          it. And I notice. Every time.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          I want you to know that I see all the effort that goes into those
          moments. Even the things you think no one notices—the late nights, the
          frustration you push through, the self-doubt you have to fight
          off—they’re not invisible to me. They’re part of the reason I’m so
          proud of you, because you keep going even when it’s not easy.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          Your pride in yourself matters to me because it’s a reminder that
          you’re not just living for other people’s approval—you’re building a
          life that feels right to you. And when I see you happy in that way, it
          makes me happy too, because it means you’re giving yourself credit
          where it’s due.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          So when you’re happy and proud of yourself, let yourself enjoy it
          without shrinking it down. Don’t rush past it. Sit in it. You deserve
          to feel that, and I’ll be right here, celebrating alongside you—not
          because I’m surprised you could do it, but because I always knew you
          could.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">I'm proud of you too,</p>
