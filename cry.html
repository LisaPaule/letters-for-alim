        <p class="textopen">My Alim,</p>
        <p class="textopen">
          If you feel like you need to cry, then that's okay. I hope you know
          that—really know it. Crying doesn't make you weak, and it sure as hell
          doesn't make me see you any differently. If anything, it reminds me
          how deeply you feel, how much heart you carry inside you. And that's
          one of the many, many things I adore about you.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          But if I'm being honest? The thought of you crying makes my chest ache
          in a way I can't even explain. It's like someone's wringing my heart
          out like a wet cloth, and I hate knowing that something has made you
          feel this way. If I could, I'd steal away whatever's hurting you and
          drop-kick it into another dimension. And if that didn't work, I'd
          bribe it with snacks until it agreed to leave you alone.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          I don't want you to feel like you have to go through this alone. If
          you're at that point right now, I hope you'll tell me, because I want
          to be here for you—not just in the easy moments, but in the hard ones
          too. And if you don't feel like talking, that's okay. Let this letter
          be my way of reaching out to you, of wrapping you up in something
          warm, even from afar.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">
          You are strong, not because you hold everything in, but because you
          allow yourself to feel. And no matter what, I will always believe in
          you. So if you need to cry, cry. But just know that after, I'll be
          right here, ready to make you smile again—probably with a dumb joke or
          an attempt at something stupid and likely awkward that I'll regret
          immediately.
        </p>
        <p class="textopen">(You're welcome in advance.)</p>
        <p class="textopen">Love you! Your pwd</p>
