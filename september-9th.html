      <h1>Day 14 Post-Break Up</h1>
      <p>
        It's funny how I was so convinced it would be incredibly hard to move on
        from you, but it took me one fun time out drinking and a healthy routine
        to feel happy again. One thing I feel I need to mention is that
        throughout all of this–the talks with Adelina, the tears shed over you
        and the fights with my family over whether there was a bet, whether I'm
        a slut or not, and whatever other conversation I was forced to indulge
        in because of you–I never lied. I never defamed our relationship and I'm
        more aware of the ups and the downs we had. I didn't read through our
        chats because I know it wouldn't have been healthy. I left our shared
        folder because I knew one day you'd do it first and I didn't want to
        wait for that day. I'm stopping to chase you.
      </p>
      <p>
        But you know what's funny? Throughout it, I continue thinking: He never
        said he doesn't love me anymore. You never said you fell out of love or
        that there was no future. You seemed hurt when I said there was no
        chance in the future. And I mean that. I've thought long and hard and
        I've come to the realisation we're entirely different in our
        communication. So unless you are willing and able to give me a full
        rundown of the events that led to this, I don't see how the trust could
        ever be restored. And maybe that's the point. Maybe it shouldn't. Maybe
        we both deserve different–not better, because we were quite perfect.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm starting to willingly forget you and I welcome the peace that comes
        with that. I'm starting to forgive myself for letting you walk away, and
        I welcome that because when I rationalise it, I realise time and time
        again that I held onto you so hard that my fingers bled.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll always miss you. But I also feel like I'll always feel betrayed. I
        doubt you ever think about the damage that you did, but I hold on to
        every detail like my life depends on it. I hear your voice every time
        that I think I'm not enough. How could anybody do the things you did so
        easily? It takes strength to forgive, but I don't feel strong. I
        sometimes fantasise about a time you're a little fucking sorry. And I
        try to understand why you would do this to me. You must be insecure, you
        must be so unhappy. And I know in my heart that hurt people hurt people.
        And we both drew blood, but man, those cuts were never equal.
