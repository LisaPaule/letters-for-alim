      <h1>Day 29 Post-Break Up</h1>
      <p>
        Alim, I know my opinion doesn't matter to you. And I know you don't want
        my help, but please. Please don't throw your life away.
      </p>
      <p>
        I understand being in a bad place. I understand needing space. But I'm
        starting to think we broke up because you didn't want someone there to
        help and try to fix things for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have no playroom here. I don't know you anymore and none of this is
        any of my business, but I'm just here to say that I always believed in
        you and knew you could be great, if you just put the effort in. If you
        need help, there's no shame in asking for it. I don't need to be your
        girlfriend in order to try and help you. If you asked Nelli not to tell
        me, she wouldn't. I'm not saying we're better than everyone and you have
        to come talk with us, but I'm sorry to say it like this and I don't mean
        to undermine you or your circle, but your friends (at least what I've
        seen) don't seem to care.
      </p>
      <p>
        They either don't realise how bad some of this might actually be or
        don't care for you. It's rough of me to say it like that but I don't
        know how else to put it.
      </p>
      <p>
        You were my best friends and a person I deeply cared for and trusted. I
        believe I was the same to you. But this isn't about being girlfriend and
        boyfriend.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know what's wrong, but something is. And you need to find help.
      </p>
      <p>
        If, in those messages you sent, you had any intention of speaking to me
        again or getting on good terms, if you care one bit about any of this,
        or you even just care for yourself, please find help.
