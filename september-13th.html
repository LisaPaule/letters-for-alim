      <h1>Day 18 Post-Break Up</h1>
      <p>
        It's funny I still write to you here hahaha. I know I won't reach out to
        you again, but I also want you to be able to be part of my life if you
        want to be (somehow idk). I wish we had been able to be friends, but my
        love for you and your plan to hurt me made it impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope one day we get the chance to sit down and we can talk. I hope one
        day you miss me enough to wish to try again, and I hope when that day
        comes, I love you again. I'm falling out of it. I'm talking with other
        people now. They're fun. They pick me up. They care and they show it to
        me in ways different to you. I look for you in them, but I don't find
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wish Mila had never entered your life or our relationship because then
        we'd still have a chance. But now, even if she might have been nothing,
        even if she was just a rebound or you never fell for her, you still
        chose her. You choose to love her and you left me when I needed you
        most.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wonder whether we're in No Contact or whether we're just done. I
        wonder whether you've ever went on this website again. I wonder whether
        you ever will. I wonder what'll happen if you do. I wonder whether
        you've noticed I left our shared folder. I wonder whether you have me
        blocked on WhatsApp. I know you didn't block my number, but don't worry.
        I won't reach out.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know how long I have left with these feelings inside of me. It's
        not because of you. It's barely because of me even. But there's just
        this emptiness I wake up and fall asleep with, and even when I try and
        sometimes manage to fill it during the day, it just never goes away.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't see a future anymore. I don't know why I'm writing this here, as
        physical proof, why I give you this power over me. It's not to guilt
        trip you. It's not to bring you back. You're just the only person I ever
        truly wanted. The only person I wanted to have in my life. Maybe that
        hurts too. Because if it had been up to me, I would've lived under a
        bridge with you–no money, no perspective, nothing. Just us. But I
        would've gotten a good nights rest beside you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I don't sleep through the night. I've lost 4kg since we broke up and
        I'm sure my body intends to drop even more. I have no appetite, no
        reason to wake up and feel good anymore. I started smoking, whether it's
        to piss you off from a distance or to be closer to you, I don't know. I
        force myself to smile, and it's funny because what I'm describing is the
        reason you fell out of love. I'm proving you right: I loved you too
        much.
      </p>
      <p>
        So here I sit, and I know that if I live, I'll spend the rest of my life
        on the sidelines watching another person make you happy, watching you
        forget who I am and what we were. The thought of that physically hurts
        me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wish I had come back with you that Sunday. I wonder how the story
        would've gone had I not let you go that Tuesday. I ask myself every
        single day where we would be if I had held your hand that Wednesday. I
        miss you. With every fibre of my being.
      </p>
      <p>
        So if you wake up a month from now and decide to give this another try,
        I'll be here. If you think about me in five years and wish to maybe give
        it another try, I'll be here. And if you do ever reach back out to me,
        please remind me to never let you go again.
